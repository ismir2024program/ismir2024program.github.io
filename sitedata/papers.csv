1,3,5,5,Remote,FALSE,On the validity of employing ChatGPT for distant reading of music similarity,"In this work we explore whether large language models (LLM) can be a useful and valid tool for music knowledge discovery. LLMs offer an interface to enormous quantities of text and hence can be seen as a new tool for 'distant reading', i.e. the computational analysis of text including sources about music. More specifically we investigated whether ratings of music similarity, as measured via human listening tests, can be recovered from textual data by using ChatGPT. We examined the inferences that can be drawn from these experiments through the formal lens of validity. We showed that correlation of ChatGPT with human raters is of of moderate positive size but also lower than the average human inter-rater agreement. By evaluating a number of threats to validity and conducting additional experiments with ChatGPT, we were able to show that especially construct validity of such an approach is seriously compromised. The opaque black box nature of ChatGPT makes it close to impossible to judge the experiment's construct validity, i.e. the relationship between what is meant to be inferred from the experiment, which are estimates of music similarity, and what is actually being measured. As a consequence the use of LLMs for music knowledge discovery cannot be recommended.",Arthur Flexer,Arthur Flexer (Johannes Kepler University Linz)*,"Flexer, Arthur*","Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility","Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility -> evaluation methodology; Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility -> reproducibility; MIR fundamentals and methodology -> web mining, and natural language processing; MIR tasks -> similarity metrics; Philosophical and ethical discussions -> philosophical and methodological foundations",,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dA6YiGRw7WLmcSBG-dCbmqGRjp7DpgnE/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuSiWBgkUfBCnZLa-s5uAkZIua7E-p0C/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VAG-uC-9QPHuPzJsxziqRpipsaG-LYLI/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bDKJUha7CfprIh1jVxLcMZ1aUzb7_kJK/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iebn1lBmmhCCCeFtp1VsaZyHqPVmCDBA/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07USGCGWSY,p5-05-on-the-validity,"For this paper, the meta review faces the challenge that two reviews voted for accept (including the initial meta review), and two reviews vote for rejection (both weak reject). None of the reviewers provided any input to the discussion phase despite my repeated encouragement for discussion. This leaves me as the meta reviewer with the texts of the individual initial reviews.

Among the reviews, I would argue that R3 has made crucial misjudgments and should not be taken into account strongly: R3 points out that ""only few experiments were conducted"". This is a complete misunderstanding: the related experiments had been conducted in the context of published research [10], and the submitted paper applies a different, more theoretical framework to it. Therefore, opinions about the experimental design of [10] must not be imposed on the review judgement for the present paper. Also, R3s argument related to ""Task Representation"" see inappropriate, as I would argue that the paper uses music similarity because it is a typical MIR task, and actually discusses in detail how this interacts with many other cultural constructs such as genre. Therefore, I as the meta-reviewer see little substance in the motivations for R3 to reject the paper.

R4, on the other hand, raises a series of valid concerns, such as that ""no further investigation is made which could actually be rather trivial (like checking the results of alternative LLMs)"". Overall, the critique of the paper by R4 reads similar to R2 and the initial meta-review, with the difference that R4 recommends weak reject.

In total, I would therefore argue to accept this paper as an outcome of a majority vote of three valid reviews (meta-review, R2, R4). In contrast to the other - more experimental - papers that I reviewed, I would like to emphasize my impression that reviewers seem to find it harder to establish common standards for reviews for such rather conceptual papers. 

In case the paper is indeed accepted I encourage the authors to more carefully emphasize limitations and scop of the paper, to address the concerns expressed in the reviews.","This paper focuses on using ChatGPT/LLMs to do ``distant reading'', a musicological task pertaining to the analysis of a corpora of data related to music. The primary motivation behind this is that LLMs appear to be designed to be good at this task. 

The prevailing hypothesis here appears to be that ChatGPT's ability to estimate similarity is a sufficient surrogate for human perception of similarity. 

The experimental setup uses a listening study, where they ask people to rate pairs of songs. This is followed up with asking ChatGPT how similar the song pairings are. The paper thoroughly explores the validity of the results through the lens of the statistical, internal, external and construct validity. At the surface, they find that there was a correlation between listener ratings of similarity and ChatGPT's reported understanding of similarity. However, looking at the construct and external validity, the usefulness of ChatGPT appears to fall. 

This paper formulates a fairly straightforward experiment that evaluates the feasibility of using ChatGPT for distant reading. However, as their own experiments show, it is not a particularly useful tool for this purpose. To some extent, it can be argued that this is an expected result. While the underlying LLM models used by ChatGPT and the like are certainly trained on stupendous amounts of data, it is unlikely that they are capable of knowing if song A by artist X is similar to song B by artist Y. 

Works like this are necessary to caution anyone who might assume that ChatGPT, with its infinitely large dataset and ability to answer queries, might be able an appropriate tool for music related tasks directly. I think the rigorous analysis of the validity of running experiments such as this one should be a useful blueprint for anyone seeking to run experiments probing large language models on musical concepts.

There is a minor reference issue with [3] (Graphs, maps, trees: abstract models).","**Strengths:**

1. The article applies LLMs to distant reading in the field of literary studies.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Model Diversity**: The study's focus solely on the GPT series (GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5) potentially overlooks the capabilities of other types of LLMs or AI systems like Gemini, Qwen, Claude. This limited selection might skew the generalizability of the results, suggesting the need for broader testing across different models to validate the conclusions.

2. **Task Representation**: The study restricts its evaluation to music similarity tasks to draw conclusions about the broader domain of music knowledge discovery. This narrow focus might not fully encapsulate the complex and multifaceted nature of music understanding, such as emotional recognition or thematic analysis, which could provide a different assessment of LLM capabilities.

3. **Participant and Methodological**: The paper only tested with 6 participants and 90 songs. Furthermore, the absence of detailed information on the experimental LLM prompts and a comparison of responses under different conditions (e.g., with and without Chain of Thought) leaves a gap in understanding how different interaction modes with LLMs might affect the outcomes.

4. **Interpretability and Bias**: The argument that LLMs' ""black box"" nature inherently limits their usefulness in tasks requiring interpretability is notable. However, this critique could also apply to human cognition and subjective biases in music appreciation. The lack of a comparative analysis between human and AI biases and the ability to guide LLM responses with tailored prompts suggest an area for further exploration and potentially undermines the conclusion that LLMs are unsuitable for music knowledge discovery based solely on interpretability issues.","
This is a very clearly written and revised article that researches the validity (considered from four formal perspectives) of a Large Language Model (namely in this case OpenAIs ChatGPT 3.5) for distant reading of music similarity. This is mainly done via a comparative test with human raters and it is consistently shown that inter-human consistency is larger than human-LLM consistency. The design of the paper is quite comprehensive and it draws from previously vetted material. There is a sense that the research came up with a negative result (which the authors acknowledge was expected) and thus the article became something of a speculation and justification of why this could be so. While this could be an interesting idea, there are two large problems with this endeavour: 
- It seems very apparent that a LLM is not the correct tool for the task, there being a host of applications that are able to ""hear"" the raw audio, which would be the only task that would yield a fair comparison. I do understand that the authors want to look into ""distant reading"", obviously, but there are so many apparent drawbacks from the start, that getting to the actual negative result seems quite pointless. For example, in real-world applications, it would probably be the case that most of the inputs given to the LLM were novel, and thus never considered in the training dataset, or that they would be unlabelled (audio with no name).
- More importantly, when considering the different aspects of validity, no further investigation is made which could actually be rather trivial (like checking the results of alternative LLMs). This means that other than statistical conclusion validity, which is objectively measured, the other aspects remain on the abstract, speculative realm. Were this a philosophical article, not actually based on the conclusions of an experiment, and it could have been written with this approach (which would need to be very different from the current state). As it is, it is very incomplete by design.
So, while this is an interesting read, very clear and well written (no suggestions in terms of language, no typos found, very well-structured), it is too speculative and based on non-proven assumptions for the nature of what it promises to deliver.","Reviewer #3:

""The paper only tested with 6 participants and 90 songs.""

Response: The study with only 6 participants is prior work that is only being referenced and scrutinized in our paper.

""The study's focus solely on the GPT series ... potentially overlooks the capabilities of other types of LLMs ...""

Response: This limitation of our study is already being discussed at the end of section 8.

""Furthermore, the absence of detailed information on the experimental LLM prompts and a comparison of responses under different conditions (e.g., with and without Chain of Thought) leaves a gap ...""

Response: The exact LLM prompts are provided in section 3.2. Usage of different prompts is discussed in section 7.

Reviewer #4:

""It seems very apparent that a LLM is not the correct tool for the task, there being a host of applications that are able to ""hear"" the raw audio ...""

Response: Other work on extracting psychophysical information from text (see [11] and [12]) shows that this kind of work is worth conducting.

""This means that other than statistical conclusion validity ... the other aspects remain on the abstract, speculative realm.""

Response: Throughout the paper additional experiments are being conducted, hence the article is not only ""speculative"".

Meta reviewer:

""What would be wrong about using the genre as a guiding information for music similarity?""

Response: The complicated relations between genre and music similarity are being discussed in section 5.

""A shortcoming of the paper may be that the influence of varying prompting on the ratings was not investigated.""

Response: Usage of different prompts is discussed in section 7.

""The authors could provide a bit more elaboration of the lack of symbol grounding.""

Response: We have the feeling that ""symbol grounding"" is such an elaborate problem, having been discussed for decades in AI research, that going beyond a brief, but important, mentioning in our paper would go beyond the scope of our work."

While previous research has validated the efficacy of compound tokens in music sequence modeling, predicting all sub-tokens simultaneously can lead to suboptimal results as it may not fully capture the interdependencies between them. We introduce the Nested Music Transformer (NMT), an architecture tailored for decoding compound tokens autoregressively, similar to processing flattened tokens, but with low memory usage. The NMT consists of two transformers: the main decoder that models a sequence of compound tokens and the sub-decoder for modeling sub-tokens of each compound token.

8,1,1,9,San Francisco,FALSE,Robust and Accurate Audio Synchronization Using Raw Features From Transcription Models,"In Music Information Retrieval (MIR), precise synchronization of musical events is crucial for tasks like aligning symbolic information with music recordings or transferring annotations between audio versions. To achieve high temporal accuracy, synchronization approaches integrate onset-related information extracted from music recordings using either traditional signal processing techniques or exploiting symbolic representations obtained by data-driven automatic music transcription (AMT) approaches. In line with this research direction, our paper introduces a high-resolution synchronization approach that combines recent AMT techniques with traditional synchronization methods. Rather than relying on the final symbolic AMT results, we show how to exploit raw onset and frame predictions obtained as intermediate outcomes from a state-of-the-art AMT approach. Through extensive evaluations conducted on piano recordings under varied acoustic conditions across different transcription models, audio features, and dynamic time warping variants, we illustrate the advantages of our proposed method in both audio–audio and audio–score synchronization tasks. Specifically, we emphasize the effectiveness of our approach in aligning historical piano recordings with poor audio quality. We underscore how additional fine-tuning steps of the transcription model on the target dataset enhance alignment robustness, even in challenging acoustic environments.",Johannes Zeitler,Johannes Zeitler (International Audio Laboratories Erlangen)*; Ben Maman (Tel Aviv University); Meinard Müller (International Audio Laboratories Erlangen),"Zeitler, Johannes*; Maman, Ben; Müller, Meinard","MIR tasks -> alignment, synchronization, and score following",MIR tasks -> music transcription and annotation,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ovrLChf92BfHq_ilyOqp6VIm6DOYTKMZ/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YObvTral3sonXEVYqTR-gIs_grqizI72/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yeeif-eM52-Vv73rbePu4_580JjPKdNH/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xhbn8tKt43J3OItlISBo2JOUww4rs3AS/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_RIbxSnAKvAcqTRndJQvS6l2PGkU7sE/view?usp=sharing,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07UPU6SEN7,p1-09-robust-and-accurate,,,,,

We achieve generality by training on multiple datasets -- including solo instrument recordings, pieces with time signature changes, and classical music with high tempo variations -- and by removing the commonly used Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) postprocessing, which introduces constraints on the meter and tempo. For high accuracy, among other improvements, we develop a loss function tolerant to small time shifts of annotations, and an architecture alternating convolutions with transformers either over frequency or time.

The computational base for MSA is a spectro-temporal representation of input audio such as the spectrogram, where the compositional relationships of the spectral components provide valuable clues (e.g., chords) to the identification of structural units. However, such implicit features might be vulnerable to local operations such as convolution and pooling operations. In this paper, we hypothesize that the self-attention over the spectral domain as well as the temporal domain plays a key role in tackling MSA. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a novel MSA model built on the Transformer-in-Transformer architecture that alternately stacks spectral and temporal self-attention layers. Experiments with the Beatles, RWC, and SALAMI datasets showed the superiority of the dual-aspect self-attention. In particular, the differentiation between spectral and temporal self-attentions can provide extra performance gain.

18,3,6,12,San Francisco,FALSE,Streaming Piano Transcription Based on Consistent Onset and Offset Decoding with Sustain Pedal Detection,"This paper describes a streaming audio-to-MIDI piano transcription approach that aims to sequentially translate a music signal into a sequence of note onset and offset events. The sequence-to-sequence nature of this task may call for the computationally-intensive transformer model for better performance, which has recently been used for offline transcription benchmarks and could be extended for streaming transcription with causal attention mechanisms. We assume that the performance limitation of this naive approach lies in the decoder. Although time-frequency features useful for onset detection are considerably different from those for offset detection, the single decoder is trained to output a mixed sequence of onset and offset events without guarantee of the correspondence between the onset and offset events of the same note. To overcome this limitation, we propose a streaming encoder-decoder model that uses a convolutional encoder aggregating local acoustic features, followed by an autoregressive Transformer decoder detecting a variable number of onset events and another decoder detecting the offset events for the active pitches with validation of the sustain pedal at each time frame. Experiments using the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed streaming method performed comparably with or even better than the state-of-the-art offline methods while significantly reducing the computational cost.",Weixing Wei,Weixing Wei (Kyoto University)*; Jiahao Zhao (Kyoto University); Yulun Wu (Fudan University); Kazuyoshi Yoshii (Kyoto University),"Wei, Weixing*; Zhao, Jiahao; Wu, Yulun; Yoshii, Kazuyoshi",MIR tasks -> music transcription and annotation,,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W4gBY_EmjutsJSn1xUUT4YikW3Nmbe1G/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_iXRxgXqrGNFVHh5XESpnD5jm169EMfM/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/16lZk-YBqSk_ypmZkZlSXqRroFivWVxY3/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ORPgbshIbOPrG7xibK3s_sUx0GZGmTDU/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xDpsdwRcGbmbXnzzerRpqxIN0lyctJ9Z/view?usp=sharing,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07USGD286Q,p6-12-streaming-piano-transcription,"This paper received generally good ratings from the four reviewers, as the proposed model achieves high performance while working in real time, which has been less studied. The main weakness is the lack of clarity in the model descriptions. In particular, reviewer #1 pointed out a lot of missing details that make it difficult to understand the exact model operation, and thus recommended a weak rejection. Through discussion, the reviewers concluded that many of the issues can be addressed in the camera-ready version and that the main contributions of the paper deserve to be presented at the ISMIR conference. Therefore, the authors are strongly encouraged to incorporate all comments in the revision and improve the clarity.","This paper proposes a streaming-capable automatic piano transcription method. Automatic piano transcription is a well-known task with a somewhat standardized evaluation method used since the Onsets and Frames paper (Hawthorne 2018). To make the model streaming-capable, the authors improve upon the sequence-to-sequence piano transcription model (Hawthorne 2021) so that rather than generating a full sequence of MIDI-like tokens, the decoder concerns onset or offset events in a single time frame only, at each time. The onset decoder autoregressively predicts the sequence of note onsets, and the offset decoder takes the set of active onsets and non-autoregressively predicts if any of them reached the offset.

The results in Table 1-2 show that the proposed method performs competitively with other SOTA models, while achieving 380 milliseconds of streaming latency, which I consider a strong result. While real-time / streaming capabilities are often overlooked in academic settings, a streaming-capable model can have a huge impact on the usability and interactive applications.

The proposed method section could be improved a lot to have clearer descriptions of the model:

- some details of the model architecture are missing, such as how the encoder features are fed to the decoders; I could infer from Figure 2 that it's using cross attention (aka encoder-decoder attention) on the features with a causal mask to enable streaming, but this should have been explained in the main body of the text.
- In Figure 2, each decoder layer seems to have layernorms in both the beginning and the end of the block, which is unconventional. (For context, the original transformer paper had layernorms after attention and mlp, but most implementations including T5 put the layernorms before them).
- There should be a more detailed description on the sustain pedal detection, which in the title. I'm guessing from the output vocabulary that the pedal states are predicted as part of the onset decoder's prediction, but I can't tell if the tokens represent the states (presence or absence, as written in Section 4.1.3) or the state changes (press / release).
- In that sense, it'd be helpful to include some example output sequences, to clarify if there is a preferred order of the tokens, e.g. BOS, any pedal tokens followed by notes lower to higher, and  then EOS.
- The offset decoder is described to be operating non-autoregressively, which makes sense because it just needs to determine if each active onset note ended or not at each frame, but it's easy to (mis?)understand from the paper that offset decoder also does sequence prediction, from the notations in Section 3.1 and 3.3.
- I find the notation in Algorithm 1 is a little inconsistent. I have to guess that the superscript notations like `1:k_1` and `0:n_1` denote the variable-length onset and offset sequences in each time frame, but it's unclear why `Y_t^{0:k_t}` was computed but only `Y_t^{1:k_t}` is outputted. Maybe it is to exclude EOS, or the pedal token? In any case, a caption to the algorithms block would be nice, to provide a high-level overview of the algorithm explaining the overall flow. Lines 19-26 is pretty standard greedy LM decoding, so it could become a single line.
- Given all the intricacies like the above, an open-source code and model release would be able to foster faster and wider adoption of the streaming piano transcription model.

Given that we have more space, further analyses like the following would have made it a stronger paper.

- A piano roll representation of the predicted MIDI or the ""posteriorgrams"" could be useful, space permitting, to show a qualitative visualization of the model behavior.
- Latency analysis: while 380ms is the systematic latency of the streaming architecture, the real-world latency would depend on the time between the actual and predicted onsets/offset events. A histogram of those latencies would be useful for understanding the real-world latency and its variability.

Comments:
- It would be nice to know if the model is actually usable in real-world applications, i.e. if the model is already ready for streaming transcription. An experiment made by the authors in real conditions could be a nice addition to the paper.
- I find inelegant the use of a ""while True"" loop in the pseudo-code of Algorithm 1. In my opinion, the code could be rewritten to remove this condition while keeping the same behavior (using a while y!= EOS condition and initializing y out of the loop).
- The code should be made open-source. If the authors intend to make the code open-source, they should mention it (for instance with a placeholder instead of the real link for double-blind review).
- Line 87: the word ""work"" is missing in ""this section review related WORK"".
- Line 96: I think there is a word missing after mainstream in ""In APT, the framewise transcription approach has still been the mainstream due to [...]"". Maybe mainstream ""use"" or something of the like?
- The definitions of ""frame-level accuracy"" and ""note-level accuracy"" are not given in Section 2.1.","We truly appreciate the valuable comments and suggestions and have made corresponding modifications on the original manuscript as much as possible.

To Reviewer 1:

1. We have updated Figure 2 to illustrate how encoder features are fed to the decoder, and clarified this process in Section 3.1.

2. Figure 2 has been revised to demonstrate the relationship between layer normalization and other layers.

3. We've added Table 1 to showcase the detection of sustain pedal events and the resulting output sequences.

4. In Section 3.1, we now emphasize that the offset decoder does not perform sequence prediction, but instead predicts the offset for each detected onset simultaneously.

5. The caption for Algorithm 1 now specifies that index 0 in the offset sequence represents tokens for the sustain pedal.

To Reviewers 2 and 3:

1. We have corrected the spelling mistakes throughout the paper.

2. The ""while True"" loop has been removed from Algorithm 1 to improve clarity.

3. To avoid confusion, we've replaced ""frame-level accuracy"" with ""frame-level transcription performance"" throughout the paper.

To Meta Reviewer:

1. Section 4.1.3 now includes an explanation for maintaining the full vocabulary for all decoders.

2. We've added an explanation for consistent onset and offset decoding in Section 3.4.

3. We've included the missing references:
   - Kwon et al., ""Polyphonic piano transcription using autoregressive multi-state note model,"" ISMIR 2020.
   - Dasaem Jeong, ""Real-time Automatic Piano Music Transcription System,"" ISMIR LBD 2020.

4. We acknowledge that Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) face different challenges.

To All Reviewers:

Due to limited research resources, we did not conduct more extensive model analysis. As noted in our conclusion, we recognize that decoding every frame may lead to unnecessary computations. We plan to address these issues and improve our model in future work and open-source our model in the future."

Our approach extends a generative audio framework to condition on pitch across an 88-key spectrum, velocity, and a combined text/audio embedding. We identify maintaining timbral consistency within the generated instruments as a major challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce three distinct conditioning schemes.  We analyze our methods through objective metrics and human listening tests, demonstrating that our approach can produce compelling musical instruments. Specifically, we introduce a new objective metric to evaluate the timbral consistency of the generated instruments and adapt the average Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) score for the text-to-instrument case, noting that its naive application is unsuitable for assessing this task.

The reviewers also mentioned a few points that the authors can take into account to further improve the quality of the paper.,"This work addresses the task of generating a sampler instrument. That is, it applies a generative model to produce a set of timbrally coherent audio samples that can be mapped to a range of MIDI velocities and pitches in such a way that creates a playable instrument.

Orthogonal to my review of the work’s scientific merit, I want to commend the authors for focusing on a task that is of clear creative benefit to musicians, i.e. by creating playable instruments, as opposed to simple end-to-end generation of complete tracks. This is a valuable research direction and a strong example to the community of how work on generative AI can positively impact creative professionals.

It appears this paper is based on work previously presented at the NeurIPS workshop on machine learning for audio. While my view is that this is an excellent piece of work, it does mean that my recommendation really hinges on whether this ISMIR submission contains sufficient novelty to justify its acceptance as new work.

As far as I can tell from the authors stated contributions, the framing of the text-to-instrument task and the audio codec language model solution to the task are close to identical to what was presented in the workshop paper. However, the sample-to-instrument task appears to be novel. Further, the timbral consistency metric was used as a loss function in the workshop paper, but here it appears to be present only as a metric, and is no longer used for training. Further novel contributions include: (i) the adaptation to the average CLAP score metric; (ii) the three CLAP conditioning schemes, which account for the variance induced by pitch and velocity conditioning; and (iii) and the inclusion of experiments on non-autoregressive transformers. Further, the subjective evaluation is also an improvement on the workshop paper. In particular, the choice to use a MUSHRA-style test for the S2I task is arguably more robust.

I do note the absence of any particular discussion of the topic of sampler instrument design. Indeed, sample libraries and sampler instruments constitute a significant portion of the modern music technology industry, so I'm slightly surprised that the authors have not gone into any further detail about what developing a commercially viable sampler instrument actually entails. Considerations such as round robin sampling, separate attack/sustain samples, and the use of sample zones to trade off quality with disk IO and file size are all relevant, and should arguably play a role in determining whether or not the stated aim of the paper has been achieved.

Nonetheless, my overall impression is that this work contains sufficient novelty to be of value to the ISMIR community, and so I’m happy to recommend for acceptance.","This paper discusses the use of generative systems based on neural audio codec language models to address the task of generating sample-based instruments (i.e. generating several audio files corresponding to different musical notes with different pitches and velocities and with timbral consistency) given a text prompt or an audio example. To the best of our knowledge, the generation of sample-based instruments from text (T2I) or from audio (S2I) are new MIR tasks which are introduced in this paper. The authors provide an evaluation methodology which incorporates a novel metric to evaluate the timbral consistency of a set of sounds, which is a required quality of sample-based instrument sound sets. The authors also propose three variants of a system that address both T2I and S2I tasks, and carry out both quantitative and qualitative evaluations which result in the notion that the proposed systems can successfully propose solutions for the task but a trade-off exists between timbral consistency an expressivity (measured using FAD).

The paper is well structured and very well-written, with proper references  and providing great detail, however, it is not clear if code will be available to reproduce the results. Even though a link is provided to a companion website, this does seem to only include audio examples and no code so far.

Overall I think this is a relevant paper for the ISMIR community and therefore I recommend to accept it. What follows is a list of minor comments that authors could address to improve the paper:

* L74-80: Maybe rephrase these sentences? I think they are a bit confusing. I guess the point is to highlight the idea that using parametric synthesisers or DDSP-based approaches that would pre-define some parameters is out of the scope of the work because the authors consider this would severely limit the output space, but maybe this could be clarified?

* L87: ""We introduce the text-to-instrument..."" Shouldn't ""sample-to-instrument"" task be also mentioned in this first point? Also the acronyms T2I and S2I should be first indicated here.

* L107: Maybe start the paragraph with a connector? ""The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2...""

* L112: illustrate -> illustrates (?)

* L185: ""The instrument family and source type (i.e., acoustic..."" -> I think a couple of examples of instrument families would be good  here.","Strengths:
- The proposal of the T2I/S2I task is reasonably novel and would be of key interest to many at ISMIR
- The overall parameterization of the codec LMs are straightforward and well thought out, with the randomization of the CLAP conditioning in particular a useful insight for the task.

Weaknesses:
- The overall writing coherence and presentation is somewhat poor, which significantly impacts the ability to understand the paper in depth. In particular:
1) Notation for describing the underlying generative process for the codec LM (section 2.4) is rather uncharacteristic of previous work. While one can understand the desire to make notation generalizable between the AR and non-AR methods, the current notation runs is somewhat opaque and obfuscates parts of the generative process (i.e. that the AR model is trained through next-token prediction).
2) Most of Section 3 (and Figure 2) is extremely hard to parse. It is hard to tell what Figure 2 is referring to, given that it is both referenced as part of Section 3.2 and Section 3.3. As all definitions for each evaluation metric are exceedingly similar, the paper would be significantly improved by streamlining the legibility of this section and more effectively organizing the structure here.","Thank you for your acceptance and the insightful feedback on our work!

Now, we connect the paper to our preliminary work, which was a workshop presentation that was not officially published/archived as per mlforaudioworkshop.com. Relative to that, T2I is significantly expanded here (e.g., new CLAP conditioning variants, 2 new metrics, MAGNeT). While we are the first to use LMs for S2I, we refrain from claiming it as our own considering the cited works (DDSP, GANstrument).

While we acknowledge that generating specific parts of the fully assembled sample (e.g., attack/release samples) is indeed interesting, we consider the sampler design as industry-specific and omitted a discussion due to space constraints.

We aim to add more out-of-domain S2I examples to our demo page by ISMIR. Nonetheless, our existing test set results include samples and instruments not seen during training.

We have retained our notation, which we carefully considered prior to submission. With $\mathbf{x}_k(…)$, the args $(…)$ enable the selection of different waveforms $\mathbf{x}_k$. Equation 1 is defined to encapsulate both AR and non-AR processes. Although the equations may appear similar, they capture the subtleties of the various topics introduced in this paper, which are essential to our methodology.

Now, we note that DAC supports up to 9 codebooks. As listed in our future work, we have since fine-tuned DAC and trained corresponding LMs, and hope to provide examples on our site leading up to ISMIR.

Generally, we have addressed connectors, typos, and notation reminders, linking AR to next-token prediction for clarity. We add the T2I acronym upon its first use. We retain the original text in line 73-80 due to favorable comments from the meta-reviewer. While we aspire to provide code in the future, our current industry position precludes us from doing so at this time.

32,4,7,12,San Francisco,FALSE,A Stem-Agnostic Single-Decoder System for Music Source Separation Beyond Four Stems,"Despite significant recent progress across multiple subtasks of audio source separation, few music source separation systems support separation beyond the four-stem vocals, drums, bass, and other (VDBO) setup. Of the very few current systems that support source separation beyond this setup, most continue to rely on an inflexible decoder setup that can only support a fixed pre-defined set of stems. Increasing stem support in these inflexible systems correspondingly requires increasing computational complexity, rendering extensions of these systems computationally infeasible for long-tail instruments. We propose Banquet, a system that allows source separation of multiple stems using just one decoder. A bandsplit source separation model is extended to work in a query-based setup in tandem with a music instrument recognition PaSST model. On the MoisesDB dataset, Banquet — at only 24.9 M trainable parameters — performed on par with or better than the significantly more complex 6-stem Hybrid Transformer Demucs.

We ask that the authors make minor revisions to better-motivate the use of a query-based system (as opposed to instrument labels). The advantages of the query-based approach are a bit unclear, given that the paper does not study generalization to instruments unseen during training (which would obviously preclude a label-based approach).

Please also incorporate the missing references identified in the reviews.

Finally, the comments about Moises around Line 85 could be interpreted as advertisement, which has no place in an academic paper. Please consider toning down this discussion of Moises, or adding commentary on other >4 stem commercial systems (e.g., Lalal.ai, audioshake).","This paper presents a system called Banquet, which aims to separate musical audio into different parts (stems) using a single decoder. The system is designed to handle more than the usual four stems (vocals, drums, bass, and other) and uses a query-based approach to identify which instrument to separate. The strategy of using one decoder for multiple stems is useful because it simplifies the model and reduces computational complexity. The system integrates a bandsplit source separation model with a query-based setup and a music instrument recognition model (PaSST). The results are competitive wrt. the SOTA HT-Demucs, even though they only exceed its SNR slightly for guitar and piano.

The authors show that Banquet can perform well on common instrument types like vocals, drums, and bass, and even some less common ones like guitar and piano using the MoisesDB dataset. This suggests that their approach has potential in broader applications. I appreciate that the authors aim to push beyond the standard four-stem setup and address the need for more flexible source separation systems.

The paper is well-written and well structured, has extensive discussion and a valid scientific approach.

My main concern is that the authors don't motivate clearly their use of a query-based approach. At train time, they use instrument labels to retrieve queries from other songs. Therefore, a naive approach to simply use the class labels as conditioning (with some embedding layer) could work equally well. Apparently, the authors also didn't understand that conditioning on queries from different tracks defies the idea of a query-based approach, as they note in the discussion ""Interestingly, it appears that querying with excerpts from the same or different track did not affect the model performance for most stems except for electric piano."" However, it is expected that the model cannot do better with same-song queries, as it was trained on all-song queries using instrument labels.

More detailed remarks:

- The performance on long-tail instruments (less common instruments) is relatively weak suggesting that the model couldn't generalize by interpolating in the PaSSt space. This puts into question the query-based approach.
- The model’s training approach involves using queries from the same stem type across different songs. I feel this undermines the self-supervised potential of the method because it relies on knowing the instrument class. It seems like a missed opportunity to fully explore the benefits of self-supervised learning. When using queries in a supervised setting, one would at least need to compare to a non-query based approach (i.e., conditioning on the instrument label) to show that there are advantages.
- The authors missed some important references for query-based approaches, which makes it harder to place their work in the context of existing research. It is generally difficult to locate the work within other works.
- Single decoder approaches already existed. I am not sure what the new contribution is in this paper, besides using the not-yet-used MoisesDB dataset. It would be nice if the authors would have provide a better motivation and explanation to show what makes this work different or better compared to others.

Minor remarks:

- The use of the term ""stem"" is confusing. I think, ""stem type"" or ""instrument type/class"" would work better.
- The training data for long-tail instruments is very limited. The authors could have considered more aggressive data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to help improve the model’s performance on less common instruments. Another option to achieve more training examples would be to randomly mix stems of the dataset, as it is common in many SOTA source-separation works.
- The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing query-based and single-decoder systems to clearly show improvements or differences. This would help in understanding the real contributions of this work.

Conclusion:

The paper proposes an interesting system for music source separation using a single decoder and a query-based approach. I appreciate the authors' effort to create a more flexible system that can handle more than just the standard four stems. However, it has some weaknesses, especially it doesn't motivate the query-based approach and doesn't show that it improves over simply using class labels. The contribution of this work is unclear given existing single decoder and query-based approaches.

Consequently, I don't think the paper is ready for publication in ISMIR 2024.","The paper presents an approach for music source separation beyond the traditional 4 stem setup of vocals, other, drums, and bass (referred to as VODB). In order to generalise the model capabilities to more stems, they introduced a query-based conditioning network, which based on PassT embeddings, is fed to the network. In experiments performed on MoisesDB, they evaluate the model and the subsequent stem extensions.

The paper starts very strong and the authors nicely embed the paper in the current literature. However, as mentioned above, some works are missing. Especially the conditioning through the FiLM layer was proposed earlier and should be credited as prior work. Furthermore, the introduction is very focused on the Moises DB and the models Moises is currently offering. This should be reformulated in a more neutral way or can be left out since it does not affect the research in the paper.

Section 3 is challenging because the system itself is complex, but the writing is clear and concise. Section 4.1 describes the query extraction. There seems to be a significant amount of pre-processing involved to obtain the ""correct"" query. How sensitive is the whole process on the query selection? Is it necessary to take the ""top-1"" query or is a random query good enough? Since PaSST takes 10s chunks, there might also be enough information in any source chunk unless it's not silence (or a certain amount of energy). This remains unclear and is not further discussed. 
Section 5 describes the experiments and the results. It shows structured experiments on the different levels of stem details, from coarse to fine. 

As for reproducibility, the authors provide the source code. By checking the code, it misses an environment.yaml which would be nice to be added. Otherwise it is very clean code and will help subsequent research. The results for the figures and tables are provided through CSV files. Since much compute time went into the models, will the weights be published, as well? Furthermore, I have not found the query positions for the PaSST embeddings, these might be crucial for later comparison.

All in all, I recommend this paper to be published at ISMIR 2024. It steers into a direction many researchers are no tapping. However, it is very much focused on the MoisesDB, although not >4-stems, it would be interesting to see this system's performance on Musdb, since this data is so well known in the community. Furthermore, evaluation on URMP would be a plus and maybe something to take into account in future research (although very far from the training data).

Small typos:
* footnote 7: word is missing after ""for""","This paper presents an approach for deep learning-based music source separation, using a query by example architecture, such that arbitrary types of musical sources can be extracted using the same model. The paper contains a thorough literature review, and to the best of my knowledge, the most thorough study of music source separation beyond four sources using a dataset of real music with singing voice. While the study is not perfect as noted below, I believe it is a worthy contribution to ISMIR.

Specific Comments:

- Sec. 3.1: The notation in this section feels a bit sloppy. N_{FFT}=2F=2048, isn't correct, since the input audio signal is real, unless the dc or nyquist bin is dropped. Also, wouldn't splitting the signal into subbands decrease the number of frequency bands. I believe this is represented properly in Fig. 1

- Regarding using query-by-example for picking the instrument to extract. Why not just use a learned embedding vector for each class (i.e., instrument stem type)? Given the lack of difference when using the stem from the same song vs. a different song, it seems that the network is potentially doing this anyway. It would be nice to comment or compare with this.

-Related to the above comment, it would be nice if the authors considered performance on source types that were not included in the training set. This could be one potential advantage of using query-by-example?

- It would be nice to have some baseline results, e.g., an oracle mask and noisy samples for the fine grained stems to put the presented results in context?

- Using SNR as the evaluation metric, is it surprising that RMS level is correlated with performance? Would be better to repeat this analysis with SNR improvement.","We would like to thank the reviewers for their detailed reviews. 

The changes made to the paper compared other the initial submission are as follows.

- Additional relevant work have been included. (Wang et al., ICASSP 2022 was already included as [20] in the initial submission).
- The discussion on Moises’ system has been cut down and other commercial systems were mentioned. Our intention was to highlight inflexibility in existing commercial systems, but we could understand that this might be misinterpreted.
- Thank you to R4 for spotting the typo in Sec 3.1. We fixed it to NFFT = 2(F-1) = 2048.

35,1,2,1,San Francisco,TRUE,Six Dragons Fly Again: Reviving 15th-Century Korean Court Music with Transformers and Novel Encoding,"We introduce a project that revives a piece of 15th-century Korean court music, Chwipunghyeong, composed upon the poem 'Songs of the Dragon Flying to Heaven'. One of the earliest examples of Jeongganbo, a Korean musical notation system, the remaining version only consists of a rudimentary melody. Our research team, commissioned by the National Gugak (Korean Traditional Music) Center, aimed to transform this old melody into a performable arrangement for a six-part ensemble. Using Jeongganbo data acquired through bespoke optical music recognition, we trained a BERT-like masked language model and an encoder-decoder transformer model. We also propose an encoding scheme that strictly follows the structure of Jeongganbo and denotes note durations as positions. The resulting machine-transformed version of Chwipunghyeong was evaluated by experts and is scheduled to be performed by the Court Music Orchestra of National Gugak Center. Our work demonstrates that generative models can successfully be applied to traditional music with limited training data if combined with careful design.",Dasaem Jeong,Danbinaerin Han (KAIST); Mark R H Gotham (Durham); DongMin Kim (Sogang University); Hannah Park (Sogang University); Sihun Lee (Sogang University); Dasaem Jeong (Sogang University)*,"Han, Danbinaerin; Gotham, Mark R H; Kim, DongMin; Park, Hannah; Lee, Sihun; Jeong, Dasaem*","Applications -> music composition, performance, and production",Applications -> music heritage and sustainability; Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR -> machine learning/artificial intelligence for music; MIR fundamentals and methodology -> symbolic music processing; MIR tasks -> music generation,,,,,Yes,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DeBMx3GiwXq6Jss-UNAHqg3knxh3NT38/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1niUE0tEkH0PMP_GE9EhMe1FyckKUHpSr/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ToZXB9UB1VjG19bVSX2NzE1xLd10d4E-/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zQ_ErYB9wyqKxrPflKBkMw0Y-cGPqtZc/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nszkf0Pd-htd_eHk6aTP8PpdQkgSVqO0/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07USGDGH1A,p2-01-six-dragons-fly,,,,,

Congrats, authors!

Please, address the reviewers comments as closely as possible. Especially the following:
- Cite the appropriate previous work (i.e., this is not the only audio-conditioned music generative model)
- Have a proficient English speaker to proofread the manuscript","The paper is well-written, with an extensive related work section.  The accompanying website features many interesting examples and code will be released on acceptance. The authors propose to investigate the use of textual inversion with a pretrained MusicGen model to generate variations of an existing song.

Two similarity metrics are introduced to spot copies in the generated material.

My main concern is about the original motivation and statement of the problem. If textual inversion proves to be able to capture audio features from the audio conditioning and regenerate audio with similar characteristics, we can regret that this is very close from standard continuation and that the possibilities offered by textual inversion are not fully exploited. Examples like ""Chill lofi remix ex. 1"" from the demo website is very similar to the prompt for instance, 

In this particular case, the learnt textual embeddings are only learnt from one song: I would have liked to see more general and diverse applications. 
For instance, is it possible to learn new styles / instruments / chord progressions based on a collection of songs? (in this paper style is often used as a replacement for song, which may be misleading). If such application is closer to what's mentioned in the introduction ""Given a few images (3-5) of a concept or object"", it is never discussed in the paper. It would also remove the necessity to introduce bottlenecks.


Some questions:
""For some song, we never achieve to obtain hearable
392 music as the result suffers from glitches, and tempo instabilities."": is it possible to automatically know when this method fails?

Some things to clarify in §4.4:
-nearest neighbours written i_1^C but chunks indexed with i,j: this is confusing, is it done on the chunk or song level?
-""However, if a model copies the conditioning (i.e. xG ≈ xC) the metric will tend to 1, we thus need a second metric to avoid xG and xC being too similar."" it sounds as if the metric had an influence on the generation process
- G is the Nearest Neighbor of C: should be clearer for a subtitle, what are G and C?




Interesting paper but this may seem like a straightforward application of the textual inversion method. Choosing the audio condition from the same song when performing the textual inversion may not be the best use case as this forces the introduction of bottlenecks in the feature extractor. The comparision with different feature extractors is interesting, especially the fact that  ""Self-supervised encoder like MERT and MusicFM outperforms low level acoustic models like EnCodec."". Demos are of good quality and well presented.",Very well written and complete paper with a lot of impressive details and convincing demo results. I have troubles finding anything majorly wrong with this work and just have to say kudos for the impressive piece of work!,"This paper introduces a method for generating music conditioned on other music — using a high-level semantic embedding from another piece of music as conditioning. 

The authors evaluate their method against a textual inversion baseline (adapted from the image domain by the authors) and find that their proposed method is faster and generates higher-quality audio than the given baselines. 

The authors perform ablations of several aspects of their system and discuss challenges, like how text conditioning is ignored when audio conditioning is present, and how including too much information from a style embedding can lead to the model perfectly reconstructing the audio. 

Overall, I like the authors' approach and find their evaluation sufficient. My recommendation is Strong Accept.

**strengths**

- The claims of the paper are held together well by objective experiments and a human listening study.
- The listening examples demonstrate that the author’s proposed method generates high-quality music that “riffs” on the musical idea given in an audio “style” prompt.

**weaknesses**

- While the KNN-based objective metrics make intuitive sense, I wonder if there’s a more interpretable way to observe the effects of which aspects of the “style” get preserved or not.  For example, I could imagine it is possible to check if the generated audio has too similar of a tempo/accents/rhythms/harmony/melodic contour as the style reference audio by leveraging pretrained MIR models/feature extractors to extract these music descriptors from both the reference and generated audio.
- The paper claims to be the only existing audio-conditioned music generative model, but VampNet (ISMIR 2023) year also claims to be an audio-conditioned model, albeit with a different approach. It would have been great to include it as a baseline in evaluations. VampNet is mentioned in line 136, but is missing a citation.",I have modified the paper according to the reviewers comments.

","This paper aims to create more practical OMR system. Most ML research suffers from insufficient 'good' dataset, and this is especially true for OMR research. To address this, the authors present an unsupervised Domain Adaptation method using a synthetic dataset. They carefully designed the loss function, and the entire technical process is explained in detail in the paper. Compared to previous works that utilize DA, this work targets an end-to-end approach, and the results clarified the effectiveness of their method. 

While this paper uses different DA architectures and loss functions, I feel that it lacks a comparison with previous works. What are the differences and similarities between this work and ""Domain adaptation for staff-region retrieval of music score images"" by Castellanos, et al., and ""Real world music object recognition"" by Tuggener, et al.?

The latter also deals with the sheet images written in CWMN, while this paper focuses on Mensural collections. Are you planning to adapt this method to the most common CWMN collections? If successful, this approach could make a more practical contribution to the MIR community, in my opinion.","= SUMMARY =

The authors propose a method to improve domain adaptation for OMR systems by fine-tuning the neural network in an unsupervised way. The approach employs two loss functions in the unsupervised stage, the first one adapting the outputs of the layers to have the same distribution (specified by mean and variance) as during pre-training. The second loss is responsible for regularisation, by maximizing within-frame symbol entropy across the minibatch and minimizing the symbol entropy within each frame. The CRNN model is pre-trained in a supervised way on a large labelled corpus of monophonic works in Mensural notation. The performance is improved consistently for 5 different target corpora of Mensural notation (both typeset and hand-written), though not achieving a performance close to in-collection training.
The work is relevant, given that (pre-)training OMR networks on synthetic data is low-threshold, but given the discrepancies of the visual characteristics, adaptation is crucial and annotating data would be costly, so that an unsupervised approach is most welcome.


= EVALUATION =

STRENGTHS:

(+) The proposed method achieves a consistent improvement across 5 independent corpora, i.e., it is always useful, which is important as the outcome cannot be evaluated when deploying the method on real data.

(+) Public datasets are used and the code will be made available to make the research fully reproducible (the code could not be reviewed, however).

(+) The activation map gives some insights on potential issues when training on synthetic (off-domain) data.

WEAKNESSES:

(-) There is still a meaningful margin between the ""after adaptation"" and the ""in-collection"" SER results, i.e., the relative improvement from off-domain training plus adaptation to in-domain training is 80% - 90% and thus, much larger than the relative improvement achieved by the proposed unsupervised adaptation method. It remains unclear whether the obtained adapted system is good enough to provide usable outputs.


Overall, the paper is well written and understandable. The topic is very relevant for the community and the proposed approach is technically sound.
The evaluation on different corpora shows the robustness of the approach.
Despite the identified weakness, the methodology provides useful insights and has the potential to contribute to other research works.

The relationship between synthetic and real data is one of the vital issues for OMR, because labeled training data is still very expensive. While the domain adaptation still is far from solving this problem (based on the results in Table 2), it certainly does help significantly.  I want to especially commend that the article performs these experiments not on one collection, but across five diffferent mensural corpora. 

The domain adaptation loss consists of two terms that each implement a clever trick. The adaptation loss term takes advantage of the batch normalization mechanism that remembers a summary of the incoming representations via their mean and standard deviations that are used to perform the batch normalization during the supervised training phase, and during fine-tuning (if I understand this correctly), it adapts the weights of the upstream layers so that the batch norm statistics coming from the in-domain data match these statistics from the supervised training phase as closely as possible (with KL divergence), so that the distributions going to the downstream layers look as close to what the network is used to from the training phase. The regularization term then prevents pathological collapses of the adaptation loss by encouraging predictions that look like plausible OMR outputs.

While these are clearly workable ideas, the paper suffers from a bit of in-domain OMR tunnel vision. By not considering related methods in more broad computer vision terms, the paper implicitly overclaims that the domain adaptation term is an original contribution. This is important and in my view must be fixed for camera-ready, if accepted. The widely cited methods that leverage batch norm statistics for unuspervised domain adaptation are not exactly the same as the proposed domain adaptation term, so this merits also some light discussion of at least what advantages and disadvantages the choices made in this paper have compared to existing methods (new experiments with these existing methods are perhaps a bit unrealistic for camera-ready, and not necessarily valuable anyway).

In order for the paper to move from showing that the idea has potential for OMR into actionable intelligence, I would also recommend a best-of-both-worlds experiment that combines domain adaptation with some amounts of in-domain data to show whether the suggested ceiling is in fact really as fragile as the glass metaphor suggests: does adding already a little bit of in-domain data help significantly?

The error analysis could also benefit from showing if there are errors that domain adaptation introduces. The delta term in Table 2 has in fact two parts — errors fixed with domain adaptation, and errors introduced by it (with the second number likely being much smaller). However, especially if some of the test domains (=different datasets) exhibits a large number of errors introduced by the method, this could offer valuable qualitative insights into the limitations of the presented method — and suggest directions for improving it towards applicability.

I recommend the paper for acceptance, especially because it is a good attempt at tackling this important problem of synthetic-to-real domain adaptation in OMR with purely synthetic training data, but with the important caveat that the domain adaptation using batch norm matching should not be presented as a new thing — it has already been explored repeatedly throughout the past years (see the comments on related work above), hence a weak and not strong accept. This is a serious omission, but it can be easily fixed in camera-ready and in my view does not detract much from the long-term value of the paper. It is a great first step to applying these techniques for OMR. I am looking forward to next steps that moves the results of this method closer to the results with in-domain training data, especially with an eye of adapting other techniques used for this in computer vision.","In response to the reviewers' comments, we made the following changes to our paper:

The SSL DistilHuBERT representations are utilized to capture the semantic information of singing voices and are further fused with the generic spectral features to facilitate beat estimation. Sources of variabilities that are particularly prominent with the non-homogeneous singing voice data are reduced by the efficient adapter tuning.

While I think the empirical evaluation is somewhat weak, this is counterbalanced by the relevance of the artifact. The system will be released and open source, making this a valuable baseline for future work on DAW-integrated models.","Strengths
I highly recognize this work for its wide range of controls that
- focus on different aspects of music, including pitch, rhythm, density and novelty, which composers would likely find important and useful; and,
- allow very high flexibility, i.e., users can choose whichever control to apply, on arbitrary track or measure.

I also thank the authors a lot for releasing their model/implementation as part of a DAW, which increases the system's potential real-world impact.

Weaknesses
(W1) Somewhat insufficient ML technical descriptions --
The authors put most of the technical details in the appendix. To enhance readers' understanding of the method, I would recommend including at least the following content in the main text:
- How does the model take care of future context? Is it by reordering, or placing future context on the encoder side?
- How are the control tokens and tokens to be generated ordered/arranged?
- What are the differences/advancements compared to REAPER v1? (The improvement seems sizable from the numbers in Table 1.)

(W2) Misleading plot about control effectiveness (Figure 5) --
I find this plot a bit difficult to understand, particularly because the control signals/levels were not shown. Perhaps a better presentation is to display generated examples conditioned on different note density levels.","**strengths**:

- strong objective evaluation of the improvements and controls added to the infilling model
- authors think about deep learning models (and the way we should control them) from a co-creative standpoint, developing their models and conditioning techniques guided by the interaction needs of a composer working with MIDI in a DAW,  co-creating with a generative model.
-  the authors contribute a fully open-source ecosystem with source code, pretrained models, and REAPER scripts for incorporating their system into a DAW. 

**weaknesses:** 

- would have been good to know about the musical background of the volunteers in the subjective evaluation.","This paper describes additional features to REAPER Infiller incorporating user controls (pitch, rhythm, horizontal and vertical note density). The methods and the model are well evaluated along with subjective evaluations.

While the paper is well written and most details are properly presented, it builds on previous work (RI). A section to review RI itself would have been helpful for an uninitiated reader. However, lines 280-289 lends some insight into the model architecture, so I am inclined to believe that the text in this paper is sufficient to understand the method.

Overall I feel this work is an important addition to RI and thus should be published. ","-De-anonymized title and text.

-Added/discussed the 3 references suggested by Reviewer 2 and Meta-Reviewer 1.

-Two reviewers felt that Figure 5 was difficult to understand. Figure 5 has been replaced with a new figure (still Figure 5) that gives more information, and the text referring to Figure 5 has been rewritten.

-""How does the model take care of future context?..."", ""How are the control tokens and tokens to be generated ordered/arranged?""

It places future context on the encoder side. (Think of an input as being a page of sheet music with some track-measures masked. The model can ""see"" all unmasked notes on the page before writing any notes.) The paper has been updated in Fig 2 and Sec 4 to make this more clear. Sec 4 was also updated to describe where the control tokens are placed.

-""In Table 1, how much of the improvement of CA2 is attributable to general improvements of the CA model, vs. the greater control signal...?""

There were some general improvements to the CA codebase (primarily around training example generation), as well as improvements to the training dataset (some additional CC0 files and some reweighting of the training data) that we did not feel were worth discussing in the paper. To ensure we made a fair comparison, the CA model in the paper is actually a retrained CA model that incorporates these improvements. Hence, the numbers in Table 1 demonstrate exactly the improvement derived from the greater control signal.

The original CA model scores are as follows:

F1 50.63; 29.98; 53.35
Precision 52.21; 33.29; 55.16
Recall 49.67; 29.38; 52.76
PCHE difference 33.92; 52.77; 33.29
Groove sim 97.85; 96.17; 97.91

Roughly, general improvements increased performance by 1-2 points, and the remaining 20-40 points of improvement in the paper come from the increased control signal from the ground truth.

61,3,5,13,San Francisco,FALSE,Content-based Controls for Music Large-scale Language Modeling,"Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of large-scale language models in the domain of music audio. Such models enable end-to-end generation of higher-quality music, and some allow conditioned generation using text descriptions. However, the control power of text controls on music is intrinsically limited, as they can only describe music \textit{indirectly} through meta-data (such as singers and instruments) or high-level representations (such as genre and emotion). \textit{We aim to further equip the models with direct and \textbf{content-based} controls on innate music languages} such as pitch, chords and drum track. To this end, we contribute \textit{Coco-Mulla}, a \textbf{co}ntent-based \textbf{co}ntrol method for \textbf{mu}sic \textbf{l}arge \textbf{la}nguage modeling. It uses a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method tailored for Transformer-based audio models. Experiments show that our approach achieves high-quality music generation with \textbf{low-resource} semi-supervised learning. We fine-tune the model with less than 4$\%$ of the orignal parameters on a small dataset with fewer than 300 songs. Moreover, our approach enables effective content-based controls. We illustrate its controllability via chord and rhythm conditions, two of the most salient features of pop music. Furthermore, we show that by combining content-based controls and text descriptions, our system achieves flexible music variation generation and arrangement.

Further, the code to be published along with the paper is a huge plus.

It is a logical approach to training controllable music generation with limited resources, using llama adaptors, and great to see a model that can take the range of modes of control that were presented. However, many reviewers point out that there is room for improvement in the evaluation. There are comments regarding the clarity around the description of the evaluation process, the presence of good baselines, and regarding limited insight into how useful each of the modes of control are to the model. Please take careful note of the each of the reviewer's comments and use them to address outstanding reviewers concerns.","This paper presents an approach for learning content-based controls for the large open-source text to music transformer model, musicGen. The controls come from an example piece of music, from which automatic chord recognition, music transcription, and audio codec features are computed. Results are presented in terms of chord recognition and beat detection accuracy, however, I found it difficult to put the results in context, as only upper-bound ground truth results were provided without any baseline or lower-bound comparisons.

Strengths:
- The proposed conditioning mechanism is clearly explained 
- Makes strong use of off-the-shelf transcription and source separation tools

Weakness:
- Some of the design choices in the proposed conditioning scheme seem arbitrary
- No baseline results (even unconditioned MusicGen) are included for chord and beat recognition accuracy
- I found it difficult to take away reusable insights about what worked and didn’t work in the proposed approach. For example, training a model without the acoustic representation input would have been insightful, as then someone could condition the model without an audio example. The large drop in performance between full conditioning and chord only conditioning make it seem like the model is cheating quite a bit with the audio and melody inputs. Since MusicGen was already conditioned using audio and melody inputs, this makes it seem like the proposed extension to chord conditioning doesn’t actually work in practice.

Specific comments:
- Table 1: It would be nice to have an example here where root and bass aren’t always the same, unless they’re required to always be the same, in which case, why do you need both?

- Section 4.2: It was unclear to me why the condition prefix tokens are the same length as the generated encodec tokens? Doesn’t the number of generated encodec tokens change over time?

- Equations (8)-(13) the notation for the W matrices appears to be overloaded, e.g., the same W symbols are used for (8) and (11), but they must certainly mean different things?

- End of Section 4.2, it would be nice to list the symbols or refer to the equation numbers  to specify exactly what the trainable parameters are. For example, I’m unclear as to what the “joint embedding” trainable parameters are.

- End of Section 4.2, assigning a random text description during training. Why do this, as opposed to no text conditioning at all? It seems like this could very negatively impact fine-tuning, and makes it difficult to trust this work without exploring this aspect more.

- Table 2: why not include chord and beat accuracy results for unconditioned musicgen as a lower bound?

- Table 3: Why are the CLAP score results so much higher than in Table 2 and never discussed? Is this a typo?

- Section 5.2: How are the 20s samples chosen? Randomly? Can they overlap? Without this information, I’m unclear what an epoch means?

- Section 5.3: I’m confused about the different FAD scores. Why is * higher? Wouldn’t we expect * to be lower (i.e., better) since it includes the audio used for conditioning?

- Section 5.4: The authors state that the approach “maintains text-control ability.” What is the evidence for this? It appears CLAP score drops quite a bit.

- Section 5.4.1: The text in this section doesn’t seem to match what I see in Table 3.  As the number of trainable layers increases, Table 3 appears to show an increase in CLAP score, not a reduction as stated in the text. ","This paper utilizes frame-wise chord, midi, and content representations as conditions for content-based controllable generation. It also proposes a Condition Adaptor to efficiently train large models with small datasets and employs an attention mechanism with condition prefixes to allow condition prefixes to effectively influence token prediction. The condition prefixes are learned through self-attention layers. As a result, the paper enables efficient content-based control using only 300 music tracks. Another new finding is that such content-based control further improves the fidelity of music (Table 2 FAD Score).
Despite these many new attempts and discoveries, the paper has some drawbacks:

1. Lack of rigorous evaluation. The paper does not describe the inference method of the baseline MusicGen model. How did you infer MusicGen using the RWC-POP-100 data? Did you input chords, beat timing (i.e, [0.27, 0.88, 1.49, 2.06, 2.66, 3.26, 3.88, 4.49, 5.10]), and melody note of midi as textual representations separately? If you used text conditions such as the Main Category  of RWC-POP-100 (single word: pop), it would be meaning-less comparison. Furthermore, if this paper aims to strictly compare text vs. content-based generation, you should compare it to a model trained on natural language expressions of beat sequence text, chord sequences text, or melody note text.

2. Joint embedding. Can the concatenation and linear projection of different data be called joint embedding? According to the latest representation learning reference [1], defines joint embedding as ""which learns to output similar embeddings for compatible inputs, x, y, and dissimilar embeddings for incompatible inputs."" (in Chapter 2) The joint embedding mentioned in this paper seems closer to fusion or mixed representation.

3. Regarding the layer-wise functionality of the transformer layer claimed in line 359, it would be better to rigorously compare fine-tuning only the lower layers and fine-tuning only the higher layers separately. In this case, the influence of the fine-tuning parameters is added, lowering the validity of the message.

4. It is unclear whether the time-varying sequential conditions work because of the proposed condition prefix-based adaptor or simply due to the preserved sequence representation of condition. It is regrettable that a comparison with a sequence representation conditioned LoRA (the same conditioning method with MusicGen) was not reported.

In light of this, I recommend a weak aceept, considering that the above limitations have little impact on content-based conditioning and can be addressed in camera-ready or follow-up research.","The strengths of this paper is clear: (1) the idea of introducing musical context control for LLM based music generation systems (2) the use of LLaMA-Adapter type PEFT for this application (3) the presentation of methodology, implementation details are clear and solid.

The weaknesses for this paper are: (1) To make it more insightful, a research on the fine tuning dataset scale versus evaluation metrics can be helpful.
(2) Since nowadays music generation systems are usually not publicly available or easily reproducible due to data and compute, it's not possible to compare with other context based controllable systems such as diffusion based Music ControlNet or Mustango (which should be cited in the paper), but they should be cited, a comparison with Mustango under the same criteria is also a plus;  
(3) I'm interested in the masking scheme introduced in section 4.1.3, I'm not clear why only MIDI and acoustic embedding are masked and how would the ratio r will influence the final performance, there is no intuitive explanations or references for this justification;

It leverages pretrained models for chord estimation, f0 classification, and source separation. The preprocessed signals from these models are fed into a conditional flow matching model, which consists of a transformer with residual connections, to enable chord conditioning, melody conditioning, and audio conditioning, along with textual inputs. Classifier-free guidance is employed to ensure control adherence during the inference stage. The model was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Experimental results demonstrate that the model maintains generation quality while offering a high degree of controllability.

The paper is well-organized and clearly written. Related works are cited, the experimental design is clearly described, and the evaluation metrics are reasonable. Well-designed experiments and thorough evaluation highlight its strengths. Although the model was trained with proprietary data, the paper provides detailed descriptions of their experiments, and the inclusion of code and pretrained models facilitates reproducible research. Notably, this work bridges the gap between music analysis research from the MIR community and data-driven generative models.

This is the type of research where the novelty dictates that human subjective evaluation is paramount, but the authors decided to make it an afterthought and provide little to no detail on this part of the evaluation study. Furthermore, this part of the results is the one with more generous and misleading interpretations, as it is apparent that on all accounts except the one that could not be compared (including drum input), JASCO fared worse (still it is stated ""however, when considering melody conditioning, reaches significantly better scores""). The fact that it did not fare better is not the problem, the problem is the description of the process. The article's structure is unconventional and I fail to understand why related work appears between analysis and discussion, and why analysis is more rushed than it should be. It is also not clear why the authors chose to separate results from analysis, as it is not as clear-cut as it usually is. There are some minor typos in the text, particularly singular-plural problems (eg lines 322, 445) and excess spaces (eg lines 153, 249), which should still be revised.","The JASCO paper introduces an innovative model that advances the text-to-music generation domain, employing Flow Matching and hybrid conditioning to enable detailed control over music generation.

The samples showcased on the demo page demonstrate impressively good performance, adhering well to the specified controls.

While the paper is generally well-written and informative, there are areas where further details could enhance understanding and application:

In Section 3.1, the paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of why specific pre-trained models such as the multi-F0 classifier, the source separation model, and the melody extraction models were selected. For example, it could provide some discussions on their performance metrics, computational efficiency, or effectiveness in diverse settings. Additionally, elaborating on any adaptations made to integrate these pre-trained models into the JASCO framework would be useful. Similarly in Section 3.3, it would be helpful if the paper clarifies why the ODE solver was chosen for the inference process.

In Section 3.1 Audio, the process for converting discrete tokens back into continuous vectors needs clarification. Is this achieved through interpolation or direct mapping? Furthermore, I am curious about why the authors choose the continuous latent representation converted from the first codebook, rather than using the continuous latent tensor directly from the EnCodec model.

In Section 3.2 on Inpainting/Outpainting, the term 'Outpainting' is used without a definition, which might lead to confusion. 

In Section 4.1, the paper could include more details about the human study, such as the number of raters involved and the number of samples each assessed.

In Section 5, it would be helpful if the paper addressed the limitations or common errors associated with those pre-trained models within the JASCO system. For example, how might the errors in chord extraction or melody extraction affect the final generations?

Indeed, even though in the recent literature the quality of the generated transcription has improved thanks to the curation of large training datasets via crowdsourcing, there is still a large margin of improvement for this task to be considered solved. Aiming to steer the development of future models, we identify the most common errors from training and testing on the aforementioned crowdsourced datasets. We perform this study in three steps: First, we detail the quality of the transcription for each class of interest; second, we employ a new metric and a pseudo confusion matrix to quantify different mistakes in the estimations; last, we compute the agreement between different annotators of the same track to estimate the accuracy of the ground-truth. Our findings are twofold: On the one hand, we observe that the previously reported issue that less represented instruments (e.g., toms) are less reliably transcribed is mostly solved now.

Although there have been attempts to accelerate the iterative procedure, high-quality TTA systems remain inefficient due to the hundreds of iterations required in the inference phase and large amount of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose SpecMaskGIT, a light-weight, efficient yet effective TTA model based on the masked generative modeling of spectrograms. First, SpecMaskGIT synthesizes a realistic 10 s audio clip in less than 16 iterations, an order of magnitude less than previous iterative TTA methods. As a discrete model, SpecMaskGIT outperforms larger VQ-Diffusion and auto-regressive models in a TTA benchmark, while being real-time with only 4 CPU cores or even 30× faster with a GPU.

Traditional methods like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or Hidden Markov Models (HMM) struggle with aligning symbolic note sequences that have large mismatches. This paper proposes a novel approach using various complex manipulations (e.g., repeats, skips, block insertions, and long trills) to train a model that predicts pairwise note similarities for two 512-note subsequences. As a post-processing step, DTW is used and compared to two alternatives. The approach is shown to lead to very high accuracy, even in the presence of large mismatches, and it is directly applicable to any kind of MIDI file.

Strengths:
- Innovative Approach: The paper proposes a novel method using a transformer-based model for aligning symbolic note sequences, which addresses the limitations of traditional methods like DTW and HMM, especially in the presence of large mismatches.  
- Detailed Explanation: The model and experimental setup are explained in detail, providing a clear understanding of the approach and its implementation.  
- High Accuracy: The proposed method demonstrates very high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods and showing robustness against a large number of mismatches.  
- Reproducibility: The authors promise to provide code and datasets online, which facilitates reproducibility and further research.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity in Description: Some parts of the paper, particularly the data augmentations and certain concepts (see e.g. the comment on attention by reviewer 4) could be explained more clearly.  
- Figures 1 and 2 have been noted to either lack informativeness or be too dense. Additionally, inconsistencies in terminology and numbering in tables need addressing.  

Please also consider the very detailed and helpful comments by the individual reviewers!

Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to ISMIR and recommended for acceptance.","This paper presents a method to perform note alignment via learned representation.
It essentially learns pairwise similarity of two 512-note sequences.
The core of the method is a transformer encoder that encodes the note sequences to determine a similarity measure, which is then ultimately matched by a match extractor, using either (1) taking the maximally similar pairs, (2) using a transformer decoder to return the matches, and (3) using DTW.  DTW-based matching is done in two stages, by first roughly aligning by typical DTW path constraints, and match the notes pitch-wise so that is close to the initial DTW result.

The method is evaluated with various augmentations including repeats, skips, insertions, deletions and trills.  The results show the method outperforms baseline of using pitch-onset similairty matrix, and shows that the DTW-based processing performs the best.  The paper also shows larger models with more residual dimension and blocks perform better.
Finally, the method is compared against existing methods, which shows the method is more robust under great number of mismatches.

The paper is interesting and provides a robust method for note-level alignment, which is valuable for the community.  There are a few questions, however.

First, please state the terminal conditions for the DTW, i.e. if there are constraints at the beginning and the end of the sequences.  Second, in theory this model can be applied to sequences of arbitrary lengths, except potentially when using a transformer decoder.  It would have been nice to understand the performance when the note duration is varied (and hence the extent of nonlocal information is provided to the model is varied).","This paper presents “TheGlueNote”, a transformer encoder that predicts note similarities for the alignment of two MIDI sequences with potentially complex mismatch cases such as note repetitions, insertions, or deletions. The authors give a good introduction into the topic, and, to the best of my knowledge, reference all important related work. The core model and its extensions are described in detail, as well as the experimental setup. Together with the promise of providing the code and datasets online, this offers researches an excellent starting point for reproducing results and testing the architecture in their own scenarios. The proposed model is evaluated in three different levels of complexity (# parameters) and three different decoding variants. A comparison with suitable baseline methods is conducted and the results of the proposed model seem to be impressive, while requiring relatively row runtime. 

I therefore recommend a “strong accept” for this paper.

For the camera-ready version of this paper, I have a few minor suggestions:
- Make Fig. 1 more illustrative, e.g., by zooming in to a smaller segment and highlighting the problems for interesting sections like trills, insertions,… 
- Enhance the readability of the similarity matrices in Fig. 2 by e.g., choosing black and white colormaps and improving the contrast
- Explain the data augmentation in Table 2 better. What does gT_t2^{n_t} mean? What’s does U(-50,50) (given in MIDI ticks) mean in seconds? Does P_{repeat/skip/trill}=1 mean that the probability of repeats/skips/trills is one? Does it mean that every note is repeated or becomes a trill?
- Facilitate the quick readability of Table 4; It is very interesting to see the results individually for all pieces, but space would permit to add two more columns representing the mean score over all pieces for Default data and 20% mismatch data.","This paper proposed TheGlueNote, a transformer-based model to learn note-wise representations for note alignment in Midi files. The training data is synthesized by data augmentation with complex mismatch cases. Authors also compare three ways to extract note matches from the similarity matrix computed on the learned representations. The experiment and results are convincing, but the paper writing can be improved (see details below).


major comments:
1. Since the proposed model and data augmentation are the key parts of the paper, they should be described more clearly.
Line 183 -186
‘processed using the fixed-length structured tokenization [22, 23], which encodes relative onset, pitch, duration, and velocity.’

Data augmentations should be describe more clearly. The notations in the Table2 should be explained clearly in the paper.

Line 306
“an experiment including extended (100+ note) mismatches”
The author should describe more about how the extended mismatches are augmented. This will help readers to understand in which aspects the proposed model is robust to.

2. the confusion of the concepts

114,2,4,7,San Francisco,FALSE,PiCoGen2: Piano cover generation with transfer learning approach and weakly aligned data,"Piano cover generation aims to create a piano cover from a pop song. Existing approaches mainly employ supervised learning and the training demands strongly-aligned and paired song-to-piano data, which is built by remapping piano notes to song audio. This would, however, result in the loss of piano information and accordingly cause inconsistencies between the original and remapped piano versions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a transfer learning approach that pre-trains our model on piano-only data and fine-tunes it on weakly-aligned paired data constructed without note remapping. During pre-training, to guide the model to learn piano composition concepts instead of merely transcribing audio, we use an existing lead sheet transcription model as the encoder to extract high-level features from the piano recordings. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on the paired song-piano data to transfer the learned composition knowledge to the pop song domain.

Please see R2 on the concern on evaluation, and please also do incorporate the important missing reference to deliver a complete study.","The paper introduces a method for generating piano covers from pop songs using a transfer learning model that employs weakly-aligned data instead of strongly-aligned, note-remapped data. This method retains the musical integrity of the original piano compositions and addresses data inaccuracy issues due to forced synchronization in previous methods. The paper is overall well-written and informative, yet several aspects could be improved:

First, the proposed pairing function for weakly aligning the piano and song addresses the rhythmic distortion caused by note-remapping but relies heavily on the performance of the beat detection algorithm. The paper lacks an investigation into the accuracy and efficiency of this algorithm. Since 50% of the bars were removed due to mapping errors (mentioned in Line 303), this method results in a significant loss of data for training or testing the model. A better justification for choosing this method over others, such as midi-to-audio alignment algorithms, is needed.

Second, the use of SheetSage to extract ""high-level"" musical ideas from song audio raises some concerns. While SheetSage was primarily trained for melody extraction, which aligns with generating accurate melody contours for piano cover generation, it may not effectively handle tempo and accompaniment reconstruction. The SheetSage encoder could lead to unexpected information loss compared to using the MT3 encoder for processing song audio. This issue could be observed in the provided listening samples, where chords and tempo were reconstructed less effectively compared to melody.

Finally, considering that melody matching is a crucial criterion for evaluating the success of a piano cover system, I recommend re-evaluating the melody chroma accuracy after some post-processing to align the generation with the target. This would provide a more meaningful comparison with the Pop2Piano model. Given that the target (human composition) has a low MCA score, it is difficult to justify the performance of the proposed model without this adjustment.","Good task direction! without relying on perfect alignment is crucial for the task. The methodology is clear and well-explained. The final fine-tuning to avoid errors from beat detection is intelligent.

My first comment is that i would remove from the title ""transfer learning approach and"". Although the contributions of the paper are both, the latter for me is a strongest contribution.


However, my criticisms are mainly about the task evaluation. The subjective metrics are significantly better than the objective ones, which is noteworthy. Considering there is no bias in the subjective tests, I believe an analysis of why the objective metrics perform poorly would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to provide reasons for the musical dimensions that are not being considered, and perhaps even propose a new metric for the task.


Another point of concern is the significant cherry-picking in the examples provided. I would prefer to see the YouTube video,  ""pop2song"" and your main approach. Given that the dataset you compiled has fewer than 100 pairs, it would have been fairer to show everything. It is evident that the model does not perform like a human, but examining the cases where the algorithm fails is also interesting.
","#### Strengths

The paper ""PIANO COVER GENERATION WITH TRANSFER LEARNING APPROACH AND WEAKLY ALIGNED DATA"" presents a significant advancement in the field of automatic piano cover generation. One of the notable strengths of this work is its innovative use of transfer learning, which leverages pre-training on piano-only data followed by fine-tuning on weakly-aligned song-to-piano paired data. This approach effectively addresses the common issue of losing piano information during the synchronization process, which has plagued previous models that relied on strongly aligned data.

The methodology is robust, involving the use of a lead sheet transcription model as the encoder during the pre-training phase. This step ensures that the model learns high-level musical concepts rather than merely transcribing audio. By fine-tuning on weakly-aligned data, the model is able to retain the musical quality of the original piano performances, thereby producing more natural and musically coherent outputs. The experiments conducted across five music genres demonstrate the model's versatility and effectiveness, as it outperforms baseline models in both objective and subjective evaluations.

Moreover, the use of a decoder-only Transformer model that interleaves song audio and piano performance sequences enhances the temporal correspondence between the condition and target outputs. This architectural choice, coupled with the innovative training strategy, contributes to the high quality of the generated piano covers.

#### Limitations

Despite the strengths, the paper does have some limitations that should be addressed. One of the primary concerns is the lack of a direct comparison with the model presented in the arXiv paper ""AUDIO-TO-SYMBOLIC ARRANGEMENT VIA CROSS-MODAL MUSIC REPRESENTATION LEARNING"" (arXiv 2112.15110). This omission is significant, as the arXiv paper addresses a similar problem space using a cross-modal representation learning approach, which also aims to capture major audio information for symbolic music generation. A comparative analysis would provide a clearer benchmark for the performance of the proposed transfer learning model.

Furthermore, while the paper emphasizes the advantages of weakly-aligned data, it does not fully explore the potential limitations and challenges associated with this approach. For instance, the alignment errors between the piano segments and their corresponding song segments, even at a beat level, could introduce inconsistencies that affect the overall quality of the generated covers. ","We appreciate the reviewers' feedback and have made the following changes in the final version:

1. Added a comparison with Wang et al.'s work to provide more context and highlight our contributions.
2. Removed the figure illustrating the alignment algorithm.
3. Redrawn the system overview figure, incorporating more details about the training process.

Regarding the limitations of MCA in reflecting output quality and the inconsistencies in weak alignment, we have included them in our discussion of future work to emphasize their importance for further research.

131,3,5,7,San Francisco,FALSE,Between the AI and Me: Analysing Listeners' Perspectives on AI- and Human-Composed Progressive Metal Music,"Generative AI models have recently blossomed, significantly impacting artistic and musical traditions. Research investigating how humans interact with and deem these models is therefore crucial. Through a listening and reflection study, we explore participants' perspectives on AI- vs human-generated progressive metal, in symbolic format, using rock music as a control group. AI-generated examples were produced by ProgGP [1], a Transformer-based model. We propose a mixed methods approach to assess the effects of generation type (human vs. AI), genre (progressive metal vs. rock), and curation process (random vs. cherry-picked). This combines quantitative feedback on genre congruence, preference, creativity, consistency, playability, humanness, and repeatability, and qualitative feedback to provide insights into listeners' experiences. A total of 32 progressive metal fans completed the study. Our findings validate the use of fine-tuning to achieve genre-specific specialization in AI music generation, as listeners could distinguish between AI-generated rock and progressive metal. Despite some AI-generated excerpts receiving similar ratings to human music, listeners exhibited a preference for human compositions. Thematic analysis identified key features for genre and AI vs. human distinctions.

I strongly advise the authors to look at the detailed comments from the reviewers and address the raised points in order to further improve the publication.,"As the title states, the paper demonstrated the three piano-performance-related tasks with pre-trained (and general-purpose) audio encoding embeddings. 
The authors not only utilized existing task setups but also contributed to composing new datasets (expertise ranking and technique identification). 
The paper is written clearly and is easy to read.

The paper refers to many related papers and introduces related issues well. However, I expect more literature reviews on the downstream tasks. For example, what is each downstream task's state of the art, and what is the expectation? 

The paper covers quite a wide range of topics, as each downstream task does not have a firm benchmark. Thus, the authors also had to propose the dataset and the evaluation procedure. The paper is compact enough, but the experiments could be elaborated on more. That makes me feel the 6-page limit is short for this paper.

I have two concerns about the message of the paper.
First, I'm not convinced that the proposed projection model is the proper design for these downstream tasks. The CNN-based model only allows for the analysis of very local features, while difficulty and expertise ranking are expected to require some temporal features. I worried that the conclusion of the paper could not be general.

Second, the correlation between piece selection and expertise ranking is not discussed enough. The network might only consider the piece, not the pianist's touch or sound. The ICPC-2015 dataset slightly resolves it, but I think the discussion on this issue is important but handled enough.

I think the paper has many points of contribution. but also, I believe the paper's main message could be elaborated in both the discussion and the experiment.","- This paper discusses an approach for 3 tasks; expertise ranking, difficulty estimation, and 
piano technique detection leveraging pre-trained audio encoders. 
- Paper also introduces a dataset Pianism-Labelling Dataset (PLD).
- The authors have enumerated the contributions in the introduction. This is helpful for the reader to quickly get a clear idea about the paper. 
- This approach is the first of its kind in piano technique detection and expertise ranking. It is good to explicitly state this. The research gap in difficulty estimation is not clear in the Related Work. 
- Section 3.1.1: It is not very clear how R4 works, if a pair of performances have the same Q value. Looks like ranking is not possible with this metric when both the performances are from the persons with the same expertise level.
- It is not clear how the neural network is designed to do the n-way ranking. 

-  Fine tuned Audio-MAE is performing better in case of Expertise Ranking whereas fine tuned DAC is performing better in the case of competition dataset. Looking a bit more into the data on which these embeddings are trained with may give an explanation for this. 

- It will be interesting to see the how the embeddings of the performances of expert players differ from that of beginners. This may help to understand the nature of the information,  embeddings are able to communicate to the further layers in the neural network. 

The authors present a relatively simple approach for the discussed tasks among which some of the tasks are novel. Experiments are quite rigourous considering different embeddings and, the design of the medthodology is driven by the nature of the tasks. Various relevant  metrics are employed for evaluation. ","The paper proposes new performance-based music evaluation tasks, introduces a new dataset, and evaluates several deep pretrained audio music models as feature generators for solving the tasks.
The paper presents initial experiments with the tasks, but they are well executed and highlight the gaps that need to be addressed in the future.

Some comments:
- since fine-tuning does not seem to improve results or even seems to worsen them - explain how you chose the fine-tuning parameters (e.g. learning rate, number of epochs, etc.) and whether they might play a role in this.
- I would not attribute the poorer performance of the expertise ranking in the Chopin competition to the ""sight over sound phenomenon"". I would imagine that it has much more to do with the fact that most of the participants in the competition are experts, whereas the model is trained to distinguish between beginner, advanced and virtuoso levels.","I mainly added to the background and literature reviews to make them more coherent with the work itself, as well as some explanation on the results. I'd love to add more discussions as suggested, but was limited by space.  

I also highlighted some details that the reviewer are confused about."

We propose a novel method for controlling surprisal in music generation using sequence models. To achieve this goal, we define a metric called Instantaneous Information Content (IIC). The IIC serves as a proxy function for the perceived musical surprisal (as estimated from a probabilistic model) and can be calculated at any point within a music piece. This enables the comparison of surprisal across different musical content even if the musical events occur in irregular time intervals. We use beam search to generate musical material whose IIC curve closely approximates a given target IIC. We experimentally show that the IIC correlates with harmonic and rhythmic complexity and note density. The correlation decreases with the length of the musical context used for estimating the IIC. Finally, we conduct a qualitative user study to test if human listeners can identify the IIC curves that have been used as targets when generating the respective musical material.

Such benchmark metrics do not provide insights into the transcription quality of specific musical aspects such as articulation, dynamics, or rhythmic precision of the output, which are essential in the context of expressive performance analysis. Furthermore, in recent years, MAESTRO has become the de-facto training and evaluation dataset for such models. However, inference performance has been observed to deteriorate substantially when applied on out-of-distribution data, thereby questioning the suitability and reliability of transcribed outputs from such models for specific MIR tasks. In this work, we investigate the performance of three state-of-the-art piano transcription models in two experiments. In the first one, we propose a variety of musically informed evaluation metrics which, in contrast to the IR metrics, offer more detailed insight into the musical quality of the transcriptions.

Our method works by (1) distilling a pre-trained diffusion model for fast sampling via an efficient, modified consistency or consistency trajectory distillation process (2) performing inference-time optimization using our distilled model with one-step sampling as an efficient surrogate optimization task and (3) running a final multi-step sampling generation (decoding) using our estimated noise latents for best-quality, fast, controllable generation. Through thorough evaluation, we find our method not only speeds up generation over 10-20x, but simultaneously improves control adherence and generation quality all at once.

- An impressively extensive and detailed survey of publications on automatic music genre recognition research from 2013 to 2022.

- Detailed data and source code are provided.

- Well-informed and thought-out critical commentary that emphasizes the need to carefully (re)consider the aims, methodology and impact of music genre recognition at a fundamental level.

However, the reviewers also highlighted the following problems with the paper:

- The first sentence of the abstract is confusing and uncomfortably close to reference [129] by  Sturm, which is not cited in the abstract (but is cited in the rest of the paper). Reference [129] must be explicitly indicated in this first sentence

- Perhaps too much reliance on the (cited) methodology used and critical perspectives expressed in Sturm’s earlier survey of genre recognition work before 2013, as well as on other work previously published work by Sturm and his collaborators (also cited in this paper). Could have expanded here a little more (although there certainly are novel contributions too).

- Some objective annotation errors were found by one reviewer when a (small) sampling was performed of the raw data in in the provided “new_survey.csv” file.

- One reviewer suggested that more explicit discussion of specifically musicological issues connected to genre recognition (as opposed to just the social sciences and humanities in general). It was also suggested that a number of relevant musicological publications on genre recognition may have been missed because the survey methodology used was better suited to finding more technical sources than musicological sources, which still often tend to be less likely to be published (and indexed) electronically.

- One reviewer suggested that the paper should include discussion of related work in music auto-tagging and music representation learning, as they play key connected roles in the evolution of the field of music genre recognition during the time period in question. Related to this, it was pointed out that this paper does not adequately discuss how the kinds of datasets being used are shifting to larger ones more suitable to deep learning. This, combined with the concerns expressed by another reviewer in connection to musicological sources, suggests that this survey, while certainly extensive, may have systematically excluded certain important kinds of publications and developments relating to automatic genre recognition.

- With respect to clarity, some of the terminology used might be confusing to readers who have not read Sturm’s earlier work specifically, as this paper incorporates terms from it that are not necessarily widespread or understood by the MIR community at large.

- One reviewer suggested that it would be helpful to highlight particular publications mentioned in the survey that have been especially influential or that are of particular merit, and to provide a sense of how different publications may be connected to one another.

Thanks to the authors for submitting this work. If it is not ultimately accepted at ISMIR this year, we encourage them to revise it based on the suggestions in the individual reviews and resubmit next year, as we believe this work can be an important contribution to the ISMIR community. The authors may also wish to submit this to TISMIR, as it seems that this paper may be overly constrained by the length limitations of ISMIR.
","I'll say flat out at the start of this review: color me impressed with this paper. This work is deep, detailed, and acutely observed, and it sheds light on the need for some serious introspection within the MGR field. I am reminded of the ISMIR 2023 paper “The Games We Play”, which I was asked to review last year and enthusiastically recommended for publication – both papers issue clarion calls to stop operating on autopilot and rethink the aims and impact of scholarship in the fields studied.

	I have no problem calling the literature review exhaustive in the domain of MGR, certainly as exhaustive as I could have imagined. In particular, I like the thoughtful collection of critical studies of genre that are aggregated and presented as meaningful commentaries with which the analyzed authors are not grappling. The works of Simon Frith, Philip Tagg, Leonard Meyer, Keith Negus, and other socio-musicological theorists of genre feel like they talk about music, and musical style, in a completely different world than the vast majority of toolbuilders for MGR (or for that matter, ISMIR) research. The paper puts, beautifully, a crucial observation about the purpose and function of the 500+ papers reviewed: they are “seldom motivate[d...to learn] something about music rather than classifier performance.” In a nutshell, this is the problem with so much MIR research; it is often dramatically more concerned with Information Retrieval than with Music.

	The other meta-analytical observations of the paper are similarly trenchant. The paper reiterates and extends Sturm's concerns about the use of the GTZAN dataset, and is justified in noting the lack of caveats appended to online mirrors of the set. Section 3.8, on discussions of genre theory, suggests that the whole field may need to go back to the drawing board conceptually. What does MGR research even mean by genre, if it is playing so loosely with such a notoriously slippery eel?

	The abstract could use a little more detail on the theoretical contributions and could do with the elimination of some boilerplate. The sentence “We present several recommendations” is vague and not very useful to the prospective reader, and there's no need for the abstract to point to supplementary material.

	There are some organizational problems with this paper that feel as if they are generated from the desire to publish at ISMIR despite having a paper and topic that simply is too expansive to address within the 6-plus-n page format. Obviously, it's unusual for 'n' to be 31 pages (this doesn't bother me, but it's probably an ISMIR record), but there's also an additional supplement file describing some of the finer points of method choices, and much of what's in there, in my view, ought to be in the full paper proper. I certainly don't want to drive good work to other venues at this conference's expense, but the parsimony that is required at ISMIR seems like a real Procrustean bed for a paper of this breadth and depth. ISMIR is, decidedly, a place where it needs to be heard.","This work offers a systematic literature review for the task of Music Genre Recognition (MGR), leveraging and extending the work by Sturm et al., conducted in 2013 and considering publications up to 2022. The paper provides statistics on published works of MGR regarding these 8 axes: publication type, MGR datasets used, experimental design, figure of merit, justification of the MGR task, publication venue, presence of critic to MGR, and engagement with musical genre theory. 

Notably, the main strength of this work is its comprehensiveness compared to the work by Sturm in 2013, both in terms of the number of publications covered (1026 vs 467) and dimensions analyzed (8 vs. 3). 

In general, I find that this survey follows a continuistic approach compared to the previous work by Slurm. My main point of criticism is the lack of discussion over certain aspects that I consider crucial to understanding the evolution and current open directions of MGR. Namely:

Influence of Music Auto-Tagging (MAT): From the appearance of datasets such as the Million Song Dataset or the MagnaTagATune, a part of the community shifted their attention from MGR to MAT. While MAT differs from MGR in several aspects, including being generally modeled as a multi-label task, and working with label sets typically derived from online folksonomies instead of created by musicologists, the connection to MGR research is obvious. While I understand that this connection was not discussed by Sturm since the first relevant auto-tagging papers are contemporaneous with his survey, I find it surprising that it is not addressed in this work.

Music representation learning: Developing broad-purpose representation models that can be finetuned in multiple music understanding tasks, including MGR, has become a popular approach (including several examples already published before 2022). It is a bit disappointing that this paradigm shift is not reflected or acknowledged in this study and that these methods are simply reflected as traditional classify experiments.

Datasets. The dataset section summarizes existing publications in terms of the most used datasets and features, but it doesn’t discuss or help to understand why newer datasets are developed and used. For example, in my opinion, the community is shifting towards larger MGR datasets consisting of music distributed under permissive licenses (such as the FMA or the genre subset of the MTG-Jamendo dataset) due to a tendency to rely on deep learning approaches requiring more data and to favor reproducibility. However, these aspects are not discussed in detail.

Additionally, these are some minor comments to the authors:
- Line 80-82: In my opinion such details about file formats can be omitted if not relevant later on.
- Line 491-493: I would say most researchers interested in Genre would nowadays do some form of representation model, and probe their systems in several downstream datasets, possibly (but not necessarily) including GTZAN. The motivation is that being able to show consistent improvements across multiple music classification datasets (including MGR) suggests more robust and generalizable performance than using a single small dataset such as GTZAN. In my opinion, this sentence neglects the effort present in many of the referred publications [372, 373, 421, 521]* for developing more robust evaluation setups. 
* references from the paper.
- Section 3.7: In my opinion, many MIR researchers interested in MGR, are already familiar with the pitfalls of GTZAN. Although it is always worth mentioning it, this section could be less focused on this particular problem, and instead, develop a bit more other less-known critics to common practices in MGR.
- Section 3.8: Consider that an overall intuition of how genre theory is typically addressed from the perspective of social science and humanities would be valuable by many MIR researchers.
- Consider including [1], a work that performs MGR using GTZAN and performs a cross-collection validation to assess the generalization capabilities of the learned model (classify, feature, and generalize). 

Finally, while I appreciate the comprehensive and systematic approach of this research, my recommendation to the authors is to consider taking into account the aforementioned aspects to bring an updated perspective on MGR. 


[1] Alonso-Jiménez, P., Bogdanov, D., Pons, J., & Serra, X. (2020, May). Tensorflow audio models in essentia. In IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).","This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Music Genre Recognition (MGR) research published between 2013 and 2022, extending the previous survey done by Sturm [219]. It describes the process for the paper corpus creation, as well as the different dimensions considered when classifying the papers. Such dimensions are analysed individually and discussed, evidencing the main issues (still) present in MGR research.

The paper is dense but properly written, easy to understand and well structured. The methodology is detailed in a way that is easy to understand every step, and the analysis is synthetic but clear, providing examples for every dimension analysed. I also appreciate the new aspects not considered in the previous Sturm’s survey, i.e., analysing the engagement of MGR research with critical work and genre theory. Overall, I believe the paper could be a great addition to the conference, and therefore I am prone to recommend accepting it, even if with one reservation.

In fact, several concepts inherited from the previous Sturm’s survey, used also in this work, are detailed in the supplementary material. Having read [219] in the past, for me it was not difficult to understand the meaning of the proposed terminology, especially with regards to “Experimental Design” and “Figure of Merit”, however a reader engaging for the first time with these concepts might feel disoriented. Therefore, I am not sure if the principle of presenting a “self-contained”  paper is respected in this submission. However, I remit to the Scientific Program Chairs the decision on whether this aspect may preclude or not the acceptance. 

In terms of the methodology, one aspect of the approach that I do not particularly like, in this work as in [129], even if I do accept it, is the egalitarian vision of the corpus of MGR research, i.e. in the presented analysis every paper counts one. Even if I do understand the value of a comprehensive survey for depicting a picture of the current status of the research in the field, I also see a major limit in this approach: I am quite sure that most of the research done in the area is not properly done and neither robust from a scientific perspective, but after reading this paper I still am not sure what work is worth reading and what is not. It would be nice to have a list of which among the 599 papers may be considered a good reading.

Eventually, this was not the goal of this work, and therefore this is not a major issue, but I would like to suggest reflecting on the value of conducting a quality assessment for selecting publications that respect certain standards, instead of taking whatever is out there. It is a common practice in medical research (see [1]), where the volume of work published is huge, and maybe also a survey on MGR research could benefit from it. 

One missed opportunity, which somehow could be approached by using bibliometric analysis as also written in lines 525-529, is the lack of a more fine-grained temporal analysis of the publications in MRG research. In fact, if we consider the construction of knowledge as a process that evolved through time, it would be interesting to see how publications are temporally connected and see when things started to go in a specific direction e.g. maybe a paper using the “Classify” design with a confusion matrix, cite a previous paper using “Classify” and a confusion matrix, which cite a previous paper using “Classify” and a confusion matrix, and so on. 

I would also recommend adding a comparative table between the corpus of [129] and the one presented in this manuscript, because it might be helpful to catch easily the differences between the two corpora, instead of having only such aspects discussed in the main text e.g. lines 234, 238, 251, 269.

Lastly, I would also add in the conclusion that another main problem which threatens the validity of MGR research is the reviewers who accept for publication works that lack any sort of validity and scientific rigour, so it is not only the author's fault.  

In conclusion, I would like to thank the authors for this submission, and I hope to see in future more critical research on MGR like this one presented.

With thanks to the reviewers, there are some changes we did not make, either from respectful disagreement or spatial constraints.

* Reliance on Sturm's methodology: We see this as a legitimate and robust approach, as we are seeing what has changed methodologically since 2013
* Annotation errors: with thanks for diligence, we cannot fix without details. We welcome corrections, and our repo will have a message saying so
* Organization / self-containment: We appreciate the sympathy, and emphasize that we feel it important to address this to ISMIR, practical and cultural challenges to critical work notwithstanding
* Coverage of musicology: The supplement covers this, we feel to an adequate degree
* Highlight influential work: We already highlight work we feel is meritorious; influence could be an interesting follow-up
* Coverage of new datasets: We feel is adequate to the scope, esp. as 4/5 most used datasets are still pre-2013
* Coverage of representation learning: We feel is out of scope, like other algorithms
* Various interesting follow-ups (changes in genre itself, extended bibliometrics): Thanks! Some rich material for an extended follow-up"
155,1,1,11,San Francisco,FALSE,Harnessing the Power of Distributions: Probabilistic Representation Learning on Hypersphere for Multimodal Music Information Retrieval,"Probabilistic representation learning provides intricate and diverse representations of music content by characterizing the latent features of each content item as a probability distribution within a certain space. However, typical Music Information Retrieval (MIR) methods based on representation learning utilize a feature vector of each content item, thereby missing some details of their distributional properties. In this study, we propose a probabilistic representation learning method for multimodal MIR based on contrastive learning and optimal transport. Our method trains encoders that map each content item to a hypersphere so that the probability distributions of a positive pair of content items become close to each other, while those of an irrelevant pair are far apart. To achieve such training, we design novel loss functions that utilize both probabilistic contrastive learning and spherical sliced-Wasserstein distances.

158,1,2,15,San Francisco,FALSE,End-to-end Piano Performance-MIDI to Score Conversion with Transformers,"The automated creation of accurate musical notation from an expressive human performance is a fundamental task in computational musicology. To this end, we present an end-to-end deep learning approach that constructs detailed musical scores directly from real-world piano performance-MIDI files.  We introduce a modern transformer-based architecture with a novel tokenized representation for symbolic music data. Framing the task as sequence-to-sequence translation rather than note-wise classification reduces alignment requirements and annotation costs, while allowing the prediction of more concise and accurate notation. To serialize symbolic music data, we design a custom tokenization stage based on compound tokens that carefully quantizes continuous values.  This technique preserves more score information while reducing sequence lengths by 3.5x compared to prior approaches. Using the transformer backbone, our method demonstrates better understanding of note values, rhythmic structure, and details such as staff assignment. When evaluated end-to-end using transcription metrics such as MUSTER, we achieve significant improvements over previous deep learning approaches and complex HMM-based state-of-the-art pipelines.

The paper is written very well. The proposed method is technically solid and its effectiveness was clearly shown by the well-designed experiments.","Overall, the paper is very clear and well-written. The methodological decisions are motivated, and the evaluation is rigorous, using standard metrics, comparing with the state-of-the-art works, and with an ablation study for key design decisions. In addition, the code and pre-trained models will be released upon publication.

Since the dataset used for training and evaluation only includes piano performances (ASAP), I suggest including this aspect in the title (e.g., ""End-to-end piano performance-MIDI..."") and in the abstract.

","This work presents an approach for obtaining a musical score from a performance MIDI file based on Transformers. The authors consider a reference dataset for the experiments and compare against existing approaches (both commercial and research-oriented) with several evaluation metrics and conclude the superiority of their proposal.

The manuscript is well written and sounds technical. Also, while the authors are commited to share the code and data if the work is accepted for publication, they also share as supplementary material to the conference some examples of the results that the approach may obtain.

My only concern in the work is the exclusive use of the ASAP dataset (as labeled data). In this sense, have the authors consider any other alternative dataset, at least for a particular experiment, to assess the generalization capabilities of the approach?","This paper proposed a new end-to-end approach to performance-MIDI to score conversion using the Transformers architecture. The proposed method is well-motivated (there is no one-to-one mapping between a performance MIDI sequence and a music score note sequence), achieves good results (beating the state-of-the-art), well-explained, and supported with rigorous experiments.

Apart from the key contributions stated in the paper's introduction, the biggest advantage of this paper, from my point of view, is the detailed technical considerations presented in the paper. The use of data (labelled and unpaired), the tokenization of the music score data (11 attributes derived from the MusicXML score, and the use of space token to fulfill beat-level alignment), the data augmentation (especially the duration jitter and onset jitter to simulate human performance), and the detailed ablation study makes the paper technically strong and provides plenty of useful insights to people working on related field. I especially like the way the paper describes data-related design choices by supporting them with comparisons to previous/other settings (e.g. Section 3.1.2 Unpaired data and Table 5). Furthermore, it's great to see the ethics statement which mentions future research for other music genres.

Overall, I think it's a good paper that should be presented at ISMIR, which will have good audiences and can be very helpful to others working on related tasks.

Below are only some minor comments.

* L27: ""significant downstream applications"" => significant number of downstream applications?
* L147: ""Eq. (4)"" => Eq. (5)
* L178: ""ml_j stores the preceding measure's length for downbeat notes or is set to false otherwise."" => I'm still not very sure what ml_j is precisely. Is a downbeat note a note those onset is on a downbeat? How is it related to the measure's length?
* L205: ""an inner dimension of 3072 for the position-wise feed-forward network"" => It is said at the beginning of this paragraph that ""the backbone model follows the original architecture described by Vaswani et al."" But the original feed-forward dimension is 2048.
* L211: After reading this paragraph, it's still not clear to me what are the ""conditioning token"" and the ""space token"". These are made clear after I finished reading Section 3.1.2. It may be helpful to polish this paragraph a bit, and add a reference to Section 3.1.2.
* L234: ""space token steam"" => stream
* **Table 2**: The total number of distinct pieces, P-MIDI notes, and score notes are not equal to the corresponding sum over the train/valid/test splits.
* Table 4: Which SOTA is it in the table? Add a reference?
* Table 5: MIDI scores do not actually have stem directions. How are the stems obtained for the MIDI scores (e.g. by importing to MuseScore or Finale)? It will be helpful to mention that to improve reproducibility. Or to annotate it as a ""-"" indicating there is no stem prediction.
* L387: How are the barlines predicted after removing the time signature module? And similarly, how are the predictions converted into MusicXML format for evaluation?
* References: Some minor formatting issues for items [6, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 29, 40, 41], mostly related to capitalisation.
","We would like to thank all reviewers for their helpful comments and constructive feedback. 

We have incorporated suggestions about the scope of the paper and additional detail about the tokenization method into the title and abstract (#1).
Additionally, we clarified the explanation of the conditioning and space tokens, moving them into Section 3.1.2. and Section 2.2, respectively (#4). 
The tokenization section now includes more detail about handling polyphonic music, note ordering, and the encoding of musical time (#4 and meta #1).
Dataset statistics in Table 2 were recomputed in order to reconcile inconsistent preprocessing between different splits (#4).
Furthermore, section 3.3 now contains additional information on how MusicXML scores were obtained for baseline methods (#4).

Due to space restrictions, we were unable to insert a figure illustrating the tokenization in the paper (meta #1). However, clear code for all tokenization/detokenization steps will be available on GitHub, along with an illustration of a tokenization of a melody.

We also want to address our focus on classical music and the ASAP dataset (#3). To our knowledge, there are no other publicly available datasets which include paired performance-MIDI and MusicXML scores. CrestMusePEDB is the only other dataset in the literature with MusicXML scores, but it is smaller, not openly available, and also limited to classical music. To illustrate our method's generalization, the supplementary material includes examples of generations for out-of-genre music from in-the-wild performances. 

Finally, we fixed various typos and formatting issues (#4).
To adhere to the page limit, some changes required minor reworking of other text passages in the paper; however, no content was significantly altered."
160,3,5,9,San Francisco,FALSE,Computational Analysis of Yaredawi YeZema Silt in Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Chants,"Despite its musicological, cultural, and religious significance, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC) chant is relatively underrepresented in music research. Historical records, including manuscripts, research papers, and oral traditions, confirm Saint Yared's establishment of three canonical EOTC chanting modes during the 6th century. This paper attempts to investigate the EOTC chants using music information retrieval (MIR) techniques. Among the research questions regarding the analysis and understanding of EOTC chants, Yaredawi YeZema Silt, namely the mode of chanting adhering to Saint Yared's standards, is of primary importance. Therefore, we consider the task of Yaredawi YeZema Silt classification in EOTC chants by introducing a new dataset and showcasing a series of classification experiments for this task. Results show that using the distribution of stabilized pitch contours as the feature representation on a simple neural-network-based classifier becomes an effective solution. The musicological implications and insights of such results are further discussed through a comparative study with the previous ethnomusicology literature on EOTC chants.

However, the paper still needs to be revised before the camera-ready version. I strongly suggest the authors to carefully read all the reviews and consider all the suggestions proposed in them, since they will surely improve the current status of the paper. I will also summarize here the reasons for this recommendation and the aspects that need improvement.

All reviewers have agreed on the great value that the new dataset has for the ISMIR community, since, firstly, it introduces a tradition not previously studied by this community, especially coming from one of the most underrepresented continents in ISMIR, Africa, but also, and equally important, for the quality of the dataset, as described by the authors. Secondly, it offers an interesting analysis performed on this dataset, which proves its validity for MIR studies on it, and provides meaningful insights on its music tradition.

However, the authors should improve the paper before submitting the camera-ready version on the following aspects.

First, the readability of the paper should be improved, since the language at some points is not clear enough.

Secondly, this paper will be the reference for this dataset in the future. As such, the music tradition should be better, more systematically described. Of course, it is impossible to cover all the dimensions of any music traditions in few pages of a conference paper. Therefore, the authors should focus on those elements of the tradition that are relevant for understanding the data and its potential for computational analysis. Other aspects, such as language or notation, should be minimized, at least at this stage of the dataset. (If in the future lyrics or scores are added to the dataset, those aspects should be then explained.)

Thirdly, the design of the experiment should be better explained. Since this not my main field of expertise, I suggest the authors to carefully read the comments by the three reviewers on this aspect, and to consider them for the improvement of the paper.

Finally, details about reproducibility, regarding not only access to the data, but to the code, should be given.","ISMIR Paper Review # 160


The paper attempts to understand Ethiopian orthodox tewahido church chat using MIR techniques. It is a straightforward classification task, that uses hand-built features. The main contribution of this paper is to explore under-represented music from around the world that is being heard by millions and it should be given some major bonus points to the authors for doing this and to release a dataset openly for the public. 

— The paper clearly explains the acoustic characteristics, language associated with the chants. Further the notation that is letter and symbolic is also well explained. 

— Overall the paper is well written. 

— The dataset that is used for this work is manually collected. One can argue that there is no prior work in this regard, hence it is difficult to compare against other datasets or works. This emphasizes that this is more of a dataset paper having some experiments reported on top of it. 

— The authors collected manual features like pitch features and MFCC, and chormagram. This is kind of similar to the work by vidwans, verma, Rao on “		Classifying Cultural Music Using Melodic Features, SPCOM 2020 and should be cited specially because they  used similar ideas on pitch based and timbre based features for understanding culture specific music. 

—  The baseline features in section 4.2 cannot be said as belong to timbre based like MFCC and kind of pitch + timbre in chromatogram averaged over time. These capture global characteristics of timbre vs allowing local characteristics of pitch based features through a conv net. I would highly recommend removing the baseline word, and characterize them as timbre, pitch features etc. Dont worry about baseline. This paper aims a new dataset and a new kind of under-represented music to the MIR community. 

— It will be great to report the accuracy results by potentially running 1-2 more experiments where they combine pitch + time-average features, Mel-spectogram etc as part of the ablation studies. Further the dataset size in terms of seconds is reasonable enough. It will not be too bad to extract pretrained features from large models trained on audio set and do fine-tuning to see where they stand. 

— Another good baseline would be to have a model trained from scratch on small patches of audio and see how it does. This would not involve any hand-built features and directly operate on the audio waveform. 

— I like the fact that they have a decent discuss section that explains various connections between the intricacies of the music and the findings of a GMM estimated pitch distribution. 


Result: Somewhere between borderline/weak accept and accept. Could have been much much better.  ","This paper provides a careful, detailed and systematic approach to an underrepresented style of music in the MIR community. The introduction of the music and presentation of the research problem at hand is confident and well executed, and readers who are not familiar with this data (like me) should find sufficient explorative potential to navigate this paper.

The authors generally take good care of detailed explanations of the terminology and methodology, which is a definite strong point of this paper. Occasionally, a lack of depth becomes evident, for example at the end of Section 2, where the ""vital insights"" aren't described further. Unfortunately, the care and consistency fall heavily short in Section 4 - see more comments on this below. In its current version, Section 4 is unacceptable, pushing the review of this paper towards a weak reject. Due to the importance of the research direction, general presentation, clear musictheoretical analysis and provision of this dataset, my evaluation is a weak accept - but: The authors _must_ reconsider the statements in the evaluation part of Section 4.

### Detailed comments ###
In the supplied material, it is observable that the singer is louder in the beginning than towards the end. In ""Ge_ez_chanting_Mode_for_a_Wednesday_Prayer.mp3"" there is a sudden rise in amplitude at the end. How do you explain that? Could that be the beginning of a new chant, meaning that something happened during the cutting of the audio?

Figure 2 is difficult to disseminate. Where exactly are the first two rows of notation patterns to be found in the sentences? I can only find very few correlations. Can you elaborate that in the text? It's unclear what exactly the red boxes mean and where the ""recurring consistent melodic patterns"" appear, as stated at the end of Section 2.3. If the latter are highlighted with the arrows, then why is it first as a lyric, and then as a music notation? You mention that in the caption, but it is rather complicated.

Figure 3: Needs units on the axes. Y = number of files, X = seconds.

Figure 4: Suggestion: could superimpose the blue GMM estimations onto the red & green pitch distributions as well, thereby gain some vertical space and use the space to make a larger depiction of the superimpositions.

Table 1: Misspelling: Array -> Araray

Table 2: Highlighting of most interesting values (e.g. within-dataset maxima, cross-data maxima) is recommended. Do you have an explanation for why pitch countour stabilization (morphetic and masking) performs much worse in general than no stabilization? The only occassional improvements are seen in the cross-data results.

161: ""except for color coding"": you mean to say that with color coding it's easier to identify a mode?
Footnote 7: what do you mean by ""the reverse is not [...] true"", that Ezil YeZema Silt is not always red? Is it a concensus that these colors are/should be used for the respective modes? This is not established in the text
180, 190 & 444: the spelling of Kidase/Qidase-bet varies.
222: ""way larger"" is a colloquialism
240: could you have chosen CREPE instead of pYIN? the choices for the pitch detection algorithm and classifier could have been elaborated.
248: what does ""sliding"" refer to?
253-254: what do you mean by ""during the performance"" and ""along the whole recording""? Does the pitch drift occur the same for every audio? Did you analyze all 369 files for that?
267: ""less number of parameters"" than what?
270: ""as regard it as"" -> ""regarding it as...""?
277: Why does each training run stop at 50 epochs? What is the reasoning behind this? Do the models converge?
297: For the cross-dataset evaluation, did you not use a validation set? And did you test on the full dataset provided by [4]?
304: you mention ""15 seconds"", but in the results (Table 2) you show ""20 seconds"". Apart from that, how much silence do these durations contain?
312: 23 percentage points is NOT a ""relative small performance drop""!
313-314: from my interpretation, the combination of no calibration and no stabilization leads great results across the board. This configuration seems easiest to implement and process, and thus would be a good trade-off between maximum accuracy and efficiency.
318: from the numbers, it is not evident how you make the claim that stabilization helps ""for most of the cases"". The _opposite_ is true: for within-dataset, ALL values with stabilization are worse. For cross-data, only 5 out of 24 results are better with stabilization!
320: with -> within
323: ""...has better classifcation accuracy _than the masking_"", because this is not true for no stabilization.
336-340: It's not understandable how the described configuration was chosen for subsequent analysis! The noted performance gap between within-data and cross-data is smaller because this configuration heavily reduces the within-data performance compared to ""no calibration"" and ""no stabilization"". The only case of improvement is in 10-sec cross-data, but you have already established around l.326 that YeZema Silt should be interpreted as a long-term song-level concept, even highlighting that YeZema Silt can be signified to some extent to a 20-sec excerpt as well. Looking at the 20-sec results for your selected configuration, the results are worse again.
377-379: Is this not an expected observation, given the explanation of the three chanting modes in Section 2.2?
380: ""Fig. 6"" -> do you mean 4?
400: remove second ""g_2""

Minor comment:
It would be nice to always keep the same order of mention: A E G for Araray, Ezil, and Ge'ez. You already have that in Table 1 and Table 3, and it could be reflected in the explanation of each mode (2.2), in Figure 4, Table 4, and also in l. 34-35, where you first introduce these modes.","= SUMMARY =

The authors investigate the Chant of the Tewahido (Ethiopian Orthodox) Church, which has its roots in the 6th century, with MIR.
A primary goal is to classify three main types of the original Yaredawi YeZema Silt standard, which is shown to be feasible best with pitch contours. The pitch distributions that are characteristic for each of the three types are further analyzed with a GMM.
A corresponding, public and manually curated audio dataset will be published upon publication of the paper. The experiments include a cross-corpus comparison with an existing smaller dataset.


= EVALUATION =

STRENGTHS:

(+) Interesting ideas for modelling the chant types by pitch distribution are presented.

(+) Cross-corpus experiments and analysis.

(+) The paper is generally well written and understandable.

WEAKNESSES:

(-) Some parts of the machine learning experiment are not clearly described or well designed (see major comments below). Especially, it is not fully clear which representation is fed into the neural network classifier.

(-) All samples in the dataset originate from a single singer. (However, the cross-database analysis compensates this, partially.)


= MAJOR COMMENTS =

-General comment: It might be mentioned if all EOTC chants are monophonic or if there are also polyphonic ones.

-Introduction, ll.56-57: ""based on the analysis of a series of EOTC Chants collected in Addis Ababa, 1975."" -> It might be pointed out that the recordings originate from 1975 and if also written documents/oral statements were analyzed in the study. (It is slightly confusing when reading, given that the papers are from the 1990s).

-Section 2.1, ll.95-96: ""which need to be manipulated for the language"" -> It is not clear why and in which way (especially) audio and video need to be manipulated.

-Section 3: It would be interesting to give some information on the approximate number of EOTC schools and students in Ethiopia.

-Section 4 reads as if only pitch-related features are taken into account. However, they are compared to MFCCs etc. This is slightly confusing when reading through the paper so it should be considered to rephrase.

-Section 4.1: It is not fully clear, how the slope ""s"" is computed? Is it simply the regression line across all (stable) pitch values over time (i.e., minimizing the squared error)?

-Section 4.1: It is not understandable, which representation is input to the neural network. Is it the frequency contour of the pitch (in Hz or normalized) or a histogram (distribution)? The same applies to Section 4.2. Moreover, it should be considered to have a development split for hyper-parameter optimization and early stopping.

-Section 4.2: Taking other statistics besides the mean, e.g., standard deviation and slope, into account might give a meaningful performance boost.

-Section 4.2: A 5-fold CV might not be the best choice for the within-dataset experiment if different chants were manually segmented beforehand, so that the same chant can appear in both training and test splits.

-Section 5: ""The recording which has the highest average correlation with all the other recordings is considered as an anchor:"" -> It should be discussed/reasoned whether this approach for pitch shifting is the optimal one. As an example, it might lead to a different solution taking into account the minimum summed-up absolute (or squared) pitch shift across all samples of the dataset.

-Section 8: It might be meaningful to consider the usage restricted to educational purposes in the license when publishing the dataset.

We acknowledge them by addressing their comments, questions and suggestions to the best of our knowledge. Our revision is summarized as below: 

- We have made a modification on our title so that it best fits the content. 
- We have made significant modifications on Sections 2, 4, and 5 including their corresponding tables and figures, which raised concerns. In this regard, we removed a figure (the previous Figure 1), modified other figures (e.g. previous figures 2 and 3, now figures 1 and 2) and reduced subsections (e.g. previous Section 2.1 and 2.3) into a single paragraph or part of a paragraph. The structure of Section 4.1 and 4.2 is also rearranged.
- We have explained in more detail the reason for using masked pitch contour in analysis, although its performance on chanting mode classification is suboptimal (Section 5).
- In connection to such modifications, some of the footnotes are modified, some others are incorporated into a background section and others deleted to keep the focus. The questions raised on removed contents will, therefore, be no more issues for future readers. 
- We have addressed spelling errors and inconsistencies. 
- We have added a link to access our proposed dataset. "
163,4,7,7,San Francisco,FALSE,HIERARCHICAL GENERATIVE MODELING OF THE MELODIC VOICE IN HINDUSTANI CLASSICAL MUSIC,"Hindustani music is a performance-driven oral tradition that exhibits the rendition of rich melodic patterns. In this paper, we focus on generative modeling of singers' vocal melodies extracted from audio recordings, as the voice is musically prominent within the tradition. Prior generative work in Hindustani music models melodies as coarse discrete symbols which fails to capture the rich expressive melodic intricacies of singing. Thus, we propose to use a finely quantized pitch contour, as an intermediate representation for hierarchical audio modeling. We propose GaMaDHaNi, a modular two-level hierarchy, consisting of a generative model on pitch contours, and a pitch contour to audio synthesis model. We compare our approach to non-hierarchical audio models and hierarchical models that use a self-supervised intermediate representation, through a listening test and qualitative analysis. We also evaluate audio model's ability to faithfully represent the pitch contour input using Pearson correlation coefficient. By using pitch contours as an intermediate representation, we show that our model may be better equipped to listen and respond to musicians in a human-AI collaborative setting by highlighting two potential interaction use cases (1) primed generation, and (2) coarse pitch conditioning.",Nithya Nadig Shikarpur,"Nithya Nadig Shikarpur (Mila; University of Montreal)*; Krishna Maneesha Dendukuri (Mila); Yusong Wu (Mila, University of Montreal); Antoine CAILLON (IRCAM); Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang (Google Brain)","Shikarpur, Nithya Nadig*; Dendukuri, Krishna Maneesha; Wu, Yusong; CAILLON, Antoine; Huang, Cheng-Zhi Anna",Generative Tasks -> music and audio synthesis,Generative Tasks -> artistically-inspired generative tasks ; MIR tasks -> music generation; Musical features and properties -> expression and performative aspects of music,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H-vRUco98pLP7fCkW_S2ZuMGROgIzeUn/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U_ukptuOX3X_RU7MTrWgKKH98jkHs3zv/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NOT5skCVZv7xf9Seqp0B2fPNfRuDuCQ1/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/147BlrgUuCe8O0bEWiG_J2xLWQn7RA11G/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GGQ9kM6q38IWjaXylisTKTk_jnaCdkwy/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07UPUDDVDZ,p7-07-hierarchical-generative-modeling,,,,,

Additionally, their non-representative clique size distributions prevent realistic system evaluations. To address these challenges, we explore the untapped poten- tial of the rich editorial metadata in the Discogs music database and create a large dataset of musical versions con- taining about 1,900,000 versions across 348,000 cliques. Utilizing a high-precision search algorithm, we map this dataset to official music uploads on YouTube, resulting in a dataset of approximately 493,000 versions across 98,000 cliques. This dataset offers over nine times the number of cliques and over four times the number of versions than existing datasets.

The dataset is based on the Discogs music database and is substantially larger than related datasets.

The reviewers all agree that the paper and the dataset are a valuable contribution to the community. The paper is well-written and the methodology is clearly described. The reviewers also mention a few minor issues that could further strengthen the paper. 
","The paper presents a new dataset for the task of version identification that is significantly larger than existing datasets. The demand for datasets for this task is accurate due to the reasons presented (data volume), but mainly because of the difficulty in ensuring data quality (such as intra-click correctness) and the challenge in maintaining and disseminating the data (especially the audio associated with the tracks). Furthermore, obtaining the dataset from a source rich in metadata brought many advantages to the proposed set. Therefore, this paper is relevant.

However, I list some points that the text could be better addressed:

- While using ""official videos"" might help with the longevity of link availability, it limits the dataset to less varied versions. For example, the dataset is restricted to good recordings by professional musicians. The data will never include fan versions, such as those with specific instruments.
- DISCOGS has information on song duration. Couldn't this information be used to filter songs contained in a playlist or videos with other elements besides the target music better, rather than cutting at 20 minutes duration?
- The paper presenting Da-TACOS has a section devoted to analyzing the characteristics of a version (""What is a cover song"" or something similar to this). This is a good idea that the paper introduced, as a way to explore the dataset without being limited to a straightforward exploratory data analysis. This article could include something along these lines to enrich its analysis, especially since it would be much richer than that conducted by the group that proposed Da-TACOS (since there are more tracks and more metadata). For instance, they could examine how much versions vary in genre.
- The baseline model part seemed very disconnected from what the reader would expect to see. Instead of creating and evaluating a new architecture on different datasets, different architectures could be experimented on and applied to the proposed dataset. However, the section presented in the article resembles something a reader would expect in an article proposing a new architecture for the task as the main contribution.
- Providing different feature sets is very relevant. However, the text does not clearly specify what these features will be (it only says ""including"" some), nor how they will be formatted and made available.","The paper introduces a new dataset for version identification that features an unprecedented scale. Part of a dataset is provided with YouTube links, and audio features are available on request. The authors then briefly introduce a NN model to demonstrate a practical use of the dataset, and compare it to state-of-the-art as much as they can.

The paper is very well written and easy to follow.

Overall, the contribution of this paper is of major importance to the task of version identification. It has been showed numerous times in the literature that the high variability in the nature of music versions, the plurality of music genres and the range of clique sizes are key factors that influence the performance of VI models. Therefore, bringing a new, 1.8M versions with 330k cliques dataset is of major interest to the research community.

Moreover, the authors don't just release a massive metadata database, but explain in details the steps used to produce it. This is even more valuable for future research and datasets construction.

The baseline model is presented quite thoroughly. Authors do not elaborate much on the choice of modelling and on the set parameters, but this is understandable given the context of a dataset-focused paper. The results are presented in an extensive way, and authors honestly acknowledge the limitations of their interpretation, mainly due to the difficulty to cross compare the baseline databases.

I have very little complaints about the paper, that is quite clear as it is.
Here are a few minor remarks that could make it even better in my opinion:
- the end of section 2.1 lists a few version types that are present in the dataset: live versions, remixes, radio edits etc. I think authors should describe more these types, by providing an additional table or graph, as new types may be a valuable contribution, and will describe better the composition of the dataset.
- section 3 describes the process applied regarding YouTube content. It might be advisable for authors to remind here that audios are not disclosed as part of the database, and content derived from this copyrighted material, namely audio features, are only granted for non commercial, research purposes. I know it is stated elsewhere, but it might be worth mentioning it here.
- figure 3 is not easy to read, I suggest authors reorganize it. Maybe data can be represented for all 3 splits on a single, larger plot?
- many references are missing the conference name, references should then be carefully proofread and revamped","This work introduces Discogs-VI-YT, a dataset for version identification (VI). The dataset is created by leveraging metadata from the Discogs music database and a search algorithm to programmatically identify a large corpus of music versions. The proposed dataset surpasses existing VI datasets in size and offers more comprehensive metadata. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed dataset, a baseline VI model is also trained.

The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow. The dataset creation process is explained in detail with reasonable design choices and well-recognized limitations. 

The main weakness I found is that the discussion is limited on why the baseline trained with this large new dataset did not improve over other existing models when evaluated on the SHS100K-Test set (even for the CQTNet, which the proposed baseline model is based on). More discussion about potential causes can help readers gain more insights about the dataset, the task, or the existing models.

Music2Latent encodes samples into a compressed continuous latent space in a single end-to-end training process while enabling high-fidelity single-step reconstruction. Key innovations include conditioning the consistency model on upsampled encoder outputs at all levels through cross connections, using frequency-wise self-attention to capture long-range frequency dependencies, and employing frequency-wise learned scaling to handle varying value distributions across frequencies at different noise levels.

Consisting of two distinct phases, our framework enables the creation of synthetic emotion-labeled datasets that can serve both Music Emotion Recognition and Auto-Tagging tasks. The first phase presents a versatile method for collecting listener-generated verbal data, such as tags and playlist names, from multiple online sources on a large scale. We compiled a dataset of 5,892 tracks, each associated with textual data from four distinct sources. The second phase leverages Natural Language Processing for representing music-evoked emotions, relying solely on the data acquired during the first phase. By semantically matching user-generated text to a well-known corpus of emotion-labelled English words, we are ultimately able to represent each music track as an 8-dimensional vector that captures the emotions perceived by listeners.

175,1,2,11,San Francisco,FALSE,MIDI-to-Tab: Guitar Tablature Inference via Masked Language Modeling,"Guitar tablatures enrich the structure of music notation by assigning each note to a string and fret of a guitar in a particular tuning, defining precisely where to play the note on the instrument. The problem of generating tablature from a symbolic music representation involves inferring this string and fret assignment per note across an entire composition or performance. On the guitar, multiple string-fret assignments are possible for each pitch, which leads to a large combinatorial space that prevents exhaustive search approaches. Most modern methods use constraint-based dynamic programming approaches to minimize some cost function (e.g. hand position movement). In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning solution to symbolic guitar tablature estimation. We train an encoder-decoder Transformer model in a masked language modeling paradigm to assign notes to strings. The model is first pre-trained on DadaGP, a dataset of over 25K tablatures, and then fine-tuned on a curated set of professionally transcribed guitar performances.

While all three reviews and the independent meta-review liked the main idea and contributions of this work, they also pointed out a number of issues. Please read all the reviews to see the detailed comments. Specifically, the paper needs to clarify many important details including the network architecture, test data, the post-processing procedure, the metric on agreement between system output and human annotation, subjective evaluation instructions, and some analyses of experimental results. 

Based on the reviews and discussions, the final recommendation is ""Accept"".","This article adresses the task of assigning realistic guitar string/fret positions to the notes of a MIDI content, which is here judiciously simplified as a string assignment problem. This task is well known in the community, sometimes under the term of ""fingering"" problem. The probem is here addressed with a Transformer, trained with a masking process on the string information.

The paper is well written and clearly structured. The approach is promising, but some points are still to be clarified, in particular in the evaluation.

Regarding the title: because ""Tablature"" commonly refers to a particular type of musical score, the reader might wrongly think that the term ""tablature inference"" refers to ""tablature generation"" (analogous to ""score generation""). It might be good therefore to clarify the title.

The quintile approach judiciously allows to provide some context regarding the data that are being labelled by the model. It although raises the question of the inference of the first ten tokens, which can not benefit from any past context. How does the model handle this ? It seems important as it will arguably impact the predictions for the following quantiles and so on.

In section 4.4, it would be more clear to state, within the third sentence, the proportion of unplayable predictions (I believe that it is 0,53%, as said in the end of the section, but I think the reader will wonder that number as soon as the problem is stated). Although the introduction of 4.4 is clear, the description of the algorithm lacks details. Are we talking about simultaneous notes ? or notes in a 10-notes window ? In 3.b, how could the center note have a fret value higher than MAX_DEVIATION (which is a fret interval, not a fret number) ?

The number of tab in the fine-tuning set should be indicated.

I don't understand why the evaluation is on the 9 tablatures only. The (large) size of the datasets used in this work arguably enables a much larger evaluation.

It is great to compare the results of the proposed approach with functionnalities of existing (and well-used) software, but I regret the lack of comparison with SOTA approaches that have been published, although not necessary implemented in any software. I suspect that GuitarPro, MuseScore and TuxGuitar might not have considered the performance of this functionality as a priority (given that these software are primarily thought for score/tab visualisation/playback/writing rather than for tab midi-to-tab transcription) and might be far from sota, and rather be an ""easy"" baseline.

I don't understand why a mistake like Fig.5 (right) could occur given that the post-processing algo (4.4) is supposed to avoid unplayable content. To disambiguate, it could be interesting to illustrate unplayability (of Section 4.4) with a concrete example.

The network architecture is poorly described (2 lines). Why is the hidden size 384-dimensional ? What is the input dimension ? I guess it must be the size of the token alphabet, so what is this size ?

The second sentence of Section 4.3 seems of strong importance, but it is hardly understandable. I think that the pedagogy of the paper could be improved by illustrating the BART architecture for the reader unfamiliar with the original publication.","This paper is a nice contribution to the field of automatic transcription to tablature. It summarises prior art, uses a sensible corpus and evaluates in good ways. 
More explicit reflection on the problems of representation might be nice here - without temporal information ro representations of simultaneity in the input (am I understanding that correctly?), it's not that surprising that physically awkward or impossible results would come out. The example in figure 5 (along with the graph in figure 4) shows this well -- each decision taken individually seems sensible, except for the chords. This is especially true if the sequence of input notes had the B2 as the second note. Where the order of notes in a chord affects the result, that's a suggestion that the model is sub optimal...","The paper presents a simple solution for guitar tablature generation from MIDI in which an encoder-decoder Transformer is trained using a masked language modeling supervision scheme (masking string tokens) to assign notes to strings. The inference is done in an autoregressive fashion and some post-processing heuristics are applied to the output of the model. The model is trained on a large dataset of crowdsourced tablatures and then fine-tuned on a small set of professionally transcribed performances. 

It is not clear why the tokenization is deemed as novel in the introduction section of the paper. I understand that the model uses an existing tokenizer (MidiTok) and that the string is encoded with the track token. I encourage the authors to provide more information on why the tokenization is novel. 

Experiments compare the proposed model with a commercial system and two open-source software implementations capable of producing tablatures from score or MIDI. Given the challenges involved in assessing the quality of tablatures, the experiments include a user study. The paper provides an interesting discussion of the results and limitations of the proposed approach and suggests various ideas for future research. 

The manuscript is well-written and organized, and overall, the paper makes a good contribution to ISMIR. 

The supplementary material includes a subset of the codebase, but the manuscript does not indicate whether the code or models will be available. It would be very important to clarify whether the code and model will be available for reproducibility.

In this work, the authors present a new method to perform zero-shot amplifier/tone transfer from one recording to another. Compared to past work, the method focuses on the amplifier/tone application and the idea of having a single network simultaneously model multiple amplified devices instead of a single device with multiple parameters. In this case, all devices are various forms of tone/amplifier fx. To train a style transfer model, a tone embedding module is learned via contrastive learning. This embedding module is then used to condition a second module to process audio. Evaluation is done via comparing a few within method configurations as well as comparing against a search-based method. The search-based method, however, is only used for testing out-of-domain tones.

","Summary

In this work, the authors propose a method for zero-shot guitar amplifier modeling. They achieve this by first training an encoder in a contrastive pre-task to extract features related to audio effect style or “tone” in the context of guitar amplifiers. They then produce a tone embedding from a reference signal, which is used as conditioning to a neural audio effect modeling network, called the generator. This generator is trained with a dataset of paired examples and a reconstruction loss. The convolutional model will process a clean signal to produce an output that has the same tone as the reference signal. 

Strengths

The proposed method is well motivated and effectively builds on previous work to enable zero-shot audio effect style transfer in the context of guitar amplifier modeling.

The manuscript is well organized and the proposed method is described in sufficient detail. 

Weaknesses

Further discussion on similarities and differences with related work would help to place the proposed method within the context of existing work.

The presented evaluation may be lacking to fully understand the efficacy of the proposed method. The first experiment demonstrates that ToneEmb conditioning can enable. While a listening test is not strictly required, even a simple perceptual study would significantly strengthen the conclusions of the work. 

While the authors do provide a discussion on some potential limitations of their work, they fail to address some important aspects. For example, there is no discussion on the computational efficiency of this method. Does this model enable real-time processing? This is critical for guitar amplifier modeling applications. 

The authors do not mention if they will provide open source code or datasets. While this is not strictly required per ISMIR guidelines, it would further strengthen the work.

Questions

The claim of “unpaired references” used to train the generator may be problematic. While the underlying content of the reference and the input (clean) may be differing, these training examples are “paired” in the sense that the data must be synthetically generated such that the guitar amplifier configuration is identical between the two recordings. In other contexts, “unpaired” data generally means 

Recommendation 

The proposed method is novel in that it combines two existing methods to enable a new task of zero-shot guitar amplifier modeling. While the presented evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of some aspects of the proposed method, the evaluation could be stronger, and hence limits the potential strength of the conclusions and overall generalization. As a result, this work is recommended for a weak acceptance. The authors are encouraged to strengthen the work through more rigorous evaluation which could include a perceptual study, the inclusion of more zero-shot baselines and a more detailed case study. ","In this work, a tone embedding is developed using contrastive training. This embedding is used to train a decoder architecture that conditions on the tone embedding. The use of the embedding allows simultaneous modeling of different amp types within a single model.

Two leading conditioning strategies, concatenation and FiLM, are compared. The work is evaluated using both seen and unseen amplifiers. The authors identify current weaknesses in the system output, that the system fails to generate high-frequency components.

As pointed out by another reviewer, the architecture used for the encoder ""3.5 Implementation Details"" is unclear. This would give a lot of guesswork to anyone trying to reproduce or compare to this approach.

One point on Figure 4: the diagram suggested to me that the embedding failed to distinguish many different types of tones-as I see only two big clusters and quite a bit of overlap. That t-SNE fails to separate the amps makes me wonder how separable they are in the embedding space. Therefore, I wonder if the diversity of the modeled tones is low, if the embedding fails to distinguish between some tones, or both.

Personally, I appreciated the approach of this work. For future work, I would love to hear this approach applied to a larger range of production styles/effects, not just amplifier simulations.","This work addresses neural modelling of guitar amplifiers in the zero-shot setting. That is, it seeks to find a model that can generalise to amplifiers unseen at training time using a conditioning mechanism. This is achieved using a combination of a relatively standard GCN model for audio effect modeling, and an encoder trained with a contrastive (SimCLR) objective, where different pieces of input audio with the same processing constitute positive pairs.

In many ways this piece of work is overdue — neural modeling of amplifiers and distortion circuits has been predominantly focused to date on fitting a single device, with more complex models employing conditioning mechanisms to account for different effect parameters. Generalising to multiple different devices is more challenging, however, owing to the variety of different designs and hence behaviours, but is well suited to the zero-shot task formulation proposed here. This is, all round, a strong piece of research with a clearly motivated model design, sufficient evaluation, and a generally high quality of presentation. Whilst not a complete solution to the stated problem, this is a clear step towards it and the paper both acknowledges the current limitations and proposes viable directions for future work.

The authors appear to have chosen not to reveal which architecture they have used for the tone embedding encoder, describing it instead simply as a “contemporary audio encoder”. Given the industrial collaboration they report, I assume this is simply an IP issue. If this is the case, however, it should be directly and clearly acknowledged in the text, rather than ambiguously omitting certain details. I hope the authors will make this change in the camera-ready version.

Otherwise, given the clear merits of this paper I am very happy to recommend this work for acceptance.","We would like to thank our reviewers for their valuable feedback. Their comments have helped us further improve and strengthen our work.
In the camera-ready version of the paper, we made several updates to enhance clarity and improve the presentation of our results. We directly indicated the name of the collaboration company Positive Grid in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4, and we added an acknowledgements section to clearly mention the collaboration. We included a citation regarding other zero-shot FX style transfer tasks that do not model effects on amplifiers.
We noted that the performance of tone embedding is expected to be influenced by the number of amplifiers used in training, and we plan to address this in future work by adding more amplifiers to the training set to facilitate a better understanding of tone transformation in the generator.
Regarding the computational efficiency of our method, we mentioned the number of parameters in our generator and identified the development of a plugin version as future work. In real-world guitar effect plugins, users may not have access to GPU resources, so writing a plugin version and testing its computational efficiency or cost is considered more feasible."

To what extent is this true of music generation models? More specifically, are fundamental Western music theory concepts observable within the ""inner workings"" of these models? Recent work proposed leveraging latent audio representations from music generation models towards music information retrieval tasks (e.g. genre classification, emotion recognition), which suggests that high-level musical characteristics are encoded within these models. However, probing individual music theory concepts (e.g. tempo, pitch class, chord quality) remains under-explored. Thus, we introduce SynTheory, a synthetic MIDI and audio music theory dataset, consisting of tempos, time signatures, notes, intervals, scales, chords, and chord progressions concepts. We then propose a framework to probe for these music theory concepts in music foundation models (Jukebox and MusicGen) and assess how strongly they encode these concepts within their internal representations.

However, an illustration of the details about the used features is limited and especially the evaluation of the pseudo-generated MIDI captioning dataset is also very limited. 

Listening study: looking at the 5 audio and caption examples in the web demo page, the quality seems decent. However, the listening study reported in the paper doesn't give much information about the quality of the captioning dataset.

It would be helpful for the readers if the authors can provide detailed explanation about the used feature extraction algorithms. In this paper, the characteristics about the each of feature extraction algorithms plays critical role in the pseudo generated MIDI captions, however, in the paper, what the authors reported regarding the used feature extraction algorithms were only about which library they have used. If the authors can report the 1) performance of the each feature extraction algorithm, 2) the category of the output fields (e.g. if it's tempo extraction algorithm, then what would be the output of this algorithm, it can be numbers or some text. I can see it from result table, but it is necessary to illustrate it as detail as possible), and some more information, these would be really beneficial for readers who would want to work on pseudo MIDI captioning or other related tasks.

I also think the author can add small paragraph explaining what is the in-context learning for the readers. 

And, if the author can provide some possible list of applications using this dataset (like text-to-MIDI generation, MIDI-to-text captioning task, etc), it would be also nice for the readers. 

Also, if the authors can pick one of those tasks and show baseline result, it would compensate the lack of the thorough listening study. However, I understand that it cannot be easily added during reviewing phase. 

In conclusion, I think enhancing 1) details about the feature extraction algorithm, 2) listening study, and 3) providing possible tasks using this dataset are necessary to be published as a good paper. Currently, the dataset is novel, but the insights the readers can get from this paper is very limited.","I must confess that after my first reading, I was very sceptical about this approach of using traditional MIR algorithms to generate some annotation that then a LLM would convert into text captioning. Given the fact that the long-term motivation of the dataset introduced in this paper is to enable a different field of prompts-to-music generative models, especially symbolic music generation, I was expecting an approach that would be more human-centred for captioning the data. One idea could have been to use one of many sources of data available across various websites where people comment and describe how they feel about a particular music. This allowed among other approaches the text prompt-to-music audio field to achieve good results in the past years, especially when targeting a broad human audience. However, choosing the field of symbolic music generation somehow already implies that the target is not a random human, but more especially a musician, and therefore it is indeed legitimate to approach the captioning of music with semantic descriptors that someone skilled in music theory would use.
It is then indeed logical then to rely on the state-of-the-art MIR algorithms to extract such descriptors and then make use of LLMs to generate such caption. However, it would have been useful to discuss a little bit more the limitation of this approach, especially in opposition to a real-world musician captioning; and a small experiment could also have been useful to justify further the usefulness of generated captioning vs human captioning.

The pipeline for the generation of the dataset is clearly explained, with details on every different annotation extracted from the MIDI files of the Lakh Dataset. It would have been interesting to deliver the scripts implementing this pipeline on the repository but is not mandatory.

The two listening study that were conducted to validate the hypothesis that this pipeline would generate caption accurate to musicians are interesting. It would be probably pertinent to detail this section further, especially explaining why the PsyToolkit allows an accurate evaluation of the quality of the generated captioning. Also, again on the topic of comparing generated captioning with human hand-made captioning, it would have been useful to introduce a few human caption examples and compare if the listening results shows significant differences between those two groups.

Finally, it would have been interesting to making use of the dataset applied on a simple experiment. It is understood that this is probably the next step of the research, but this would have helped to justify further the usefulness of this dataset.

In bref;

Strength: First Dataset of MIDI Files Text Captions, Detailed and Reusable Pipeline, Fairly Musically Accurate Captions, Validated with Listening Study

Weakness: No Experiment to demonstrate the Applications of the Dataset, Not enough discussion of Generated Captions vs Human Caption, No Discussion on Future Directions for Improvements of the Captioning, Not enough Discussion on the weaknesses of the Approach","The paper is well-written and the motivation is clear, but the way they create the dataset isn't that novel since they mostly use existing models and tools. But we shouldn't expect a dataset paper to be super innovative.
What's great is that the MidiCaps dataset is really big and the automatically generated captions are pretty good quality. Putting together such a large dataset of MIDI files with matching text is valuable in itself, because it allows for new kinds of research combining symbolic music and language processing.

Results of labeling, tagging, assessment, and evaluation can be used as training data for machine learning models that estimate them automatically. For such machine learning purposes, a single target (e.g., song) is usually annotated by multiple human annotators, and the results are aggregated by majority voting or averaging. Majority voting, however, requires the number of annotators to be an odd number, which is not always possible. And averaging is sensitive to differences in the judgmental characteristics of each annotator and cannot be used for ordinal scales. This paper therefore proposes that the item response theory (IRT) be used to aggregate the music annotation results of multiple annotators. IRT-based models can jointly estimate annotators' characteristics and latent scores (i.e., aggregations of annotation results) of the targets, and they are also applicable to ordinal scales. We evaluated the IRT-based models in two actual cases of music annotation --- semantic tagging of music and Likert scale-based evaluation of singing skill --- and compared those models with their simplified models that do not consider the characteristics of each annotator.",Tomoyasu Nakano,Tomoyasu Nakano (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST))*; Masataka Goto (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)),"Nakano, Tomoyasu*; Goto, Masataka",MIR tasks -> music transcription and annotation,,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVN3Qgw_tfZC3iUYrjK2mBdM4exBcZhl/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17c0w9DoxLbJZUjA6tUriZUgnE54eOgqb/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7Hc5Jmx_LyU5wfSknSFiNyXYGg6xxgT/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BG6zTeWW-X8EG95y9GnlrTbIKM-esJo/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gtsgw0oUsPWNgawHzNeDSgBmsJLasdnk/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07UHCURWMC,p7-15-using-item-response,,,,,

Identifying repetitions in music is computationally not trivial, especially when they are varied or deeply hidden within tree-like structures. Rather than focusing on repetitions of musical events, we propose to pursue repeated structural relations between events. More specifically, given a context-free grammar that describes a tonal structure, we aim to computationally identify such relational repetitions within the derivation tree of the grammar. To this end, we first introduce the template, a grammar-generic structure for generating trees that contain structural repetitions. We then approach the discovery of structural repetitions as a search for optimally compressible templates that describe a corpus of pieces in the form of production-rule-labeled trees. To make it tractable, we develop a heuristic, inspired by tree compression algorithms, to approximate the optimally compressible templates of the corpus.

Already in the Baroque, various modes of musical artificiality were explored, ranging from automata and organ stops mimicking human performance and natural sounds, up to devices for mechanized composition (e.g., Athanasius Kircher, Johann Philip Kirnberger, C.P.E. Bach, Antonio Calegari and Diederich Nickolaus Winkel).   Valuable insights emerge from the reconsideration—and digital implementation—of these curiosities through the lens of present-day generative models. It can be argued that the very notion of ‘artificiality’ has presented humanity with long-standing philosophical dilemmas, in addressing the debate on the role of art as a substitute of (divine) nature. By digitally implementing and formalizing some pioneering instances of  algorithmically-generated music we wish to illustrate how mechanical devices have played a role in human art and entertainment prior to our digital era.",Nicholas Cornia,Nicholas Cornia (Orpheus Instituut)*; Bruno Forment (Orpheus Instituut),"Cornia, Nicholas*; Forment, Bruno",Philosophical and ethical discussions -> philosophical and methodological foundations,Creativity -> computational creativity; Creativity -> humanistic discussions; MIR tasks -> optical music recognition; Philosophical and ethical discussions -> ethical issues related to designing and implementing MIR tools and technologies; Philosophical and ethical discussions -> legal and societal aspects of MIR,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wd35AEbNSSAsSknVhi-6OXNFaTHJdnKa/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oN4xp6Z0jJeApFTE6fruD1CBM_2IjaBQ/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tShkawH3_Fc0_5EAGZp7ZfCG9nfmnRfO/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OSpNzx0I9AaqIsnNCK-qLTBMmtpAhHGQ/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k9Vy-A43gkcP4cm_nvITibfQC_Pz1nMS/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07UHELJVTQ,p3-16-who-s-afraid,,,,,

In recent years, APT has relied on supervised deep learning, which demands a large amount of labeled data that is often limited. This paper introduces a semi-supervised approach to APT, leveraging unlabeled data with techniques originally introduced in computer vision (CV): pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and distribution matching. The idea of pseudo-labeling is to use the current model for producing artificial labels for unlabeled data, and consistency regularization makes the model's predictions for unlabeled data robust to augmentations. Finally, distribution matching ensures that the pseudo-labels follow the same marginal distribution as the reference labels, adding an extra layer of robustness. Our method, tested on three piano datasets, shows improvements over purely supervised methods and performs comparably to existing semi-supervised approaches. Conceptually, this work illustrates that semi-supervised learning techniques from CV can be effectively transferred to the music domain, considerably reducing the dependence on large annotated datasets.",Sebastian Strahl,Sebastian Strahl (International Audio Laboratories Erlangen)*; Meinard Müller (International Audio Laboratories Erlangen),"Strahl, Sebastian*; Müller, Meinard",MIR tasks -> music transcription and annotation,Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR -> machine learning/artificial intelligence for music; Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR -> representations of music,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CHhf2YqFLE4yhviOEnoiWPkquE-MqLBy/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wLdS2VgE1tyDmEQWvyI0OaVOt-ZAJvL3/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qYZX0b77rH_vb-cNHkkztkV7ggpFtA3e/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvjjP5pOg0rHA1HL7ua4uD2K767PJ1_m/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DhAU3B4pLBPavXvgRt-b770pUt6p_g49/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07UQ1LBAUA,p1-16-semi-supervised-piano,,,,,

A relevant discussion and related technical challenge is the potential replication and plagiarism of the training set in AI-generated music, which could lead to misuse of data and intellectual property rights violations. To tackle this issue, we present the Music Replication Assessment (MiRA) tool: a model-independent open evaluation method based on diverse audio music similarity metrics to assess data replication. We evaluate the ability of five metrics to identify exact replication by conducting a controlled replication experiment in different music genres using synthetic samples. Our results show that the proposed methodology can estimate exact data replication with a proportion higher than 10%.

- Demo results seem particular strong, generating high quality musical accompaniments

Weaknesses:
Overall, the demo results are quite impressive, and the only current critiques are with regards to part of the evaluation: Though the paper's central goal is on building a TTM accompaniment model, the paper's evaluation does not fully assess this, in part due to a lack of comparison with relevant work. While omitting large-scale comparison to StemGen/SingSong is understandable given that they are closed-source, both models have a reasonable suite of public demo examples with the isolated context conditioning that could have been used in a listening study against the present work. More saliently, the paper omits comparison (and even mention) to the established Multi-Source Diffusion Models (MSDM), which is open source and is designed to perform tasks like accompaniment generation, and thus could be directly compared to Diff-a-Riff in large scale objective metrics (MSDM is not text-conditioned, though this shouldn't affect evaluation here). Without either comparison, it is hard to assess Diff-a-Riff's ability at its original goal of accompaniment generation relative to existing work, and such inclusions would improve the paper as a whole.","This paper is great, the novelty of this paper is okay, but the systems are very well designed and conducted.

231,3,6,9,San Francisco,FALSE,DEEP RECOMBINANT TRANSFORMER: ENHANCING LOOP COMPATIBILITY IN DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTION,"The widespread availability of music loops has revolutionized music production. However, combining loops requires a nuanced understanding of musical compatibility that can be difficult to learn and time-consuming. This study concentrates on the 'vertical problem' of music loop compatibility, which pertains to layering different loops to create a harmonious blend. The main limitation to applying deep learning in this domain is the absence of a large, high-quality, labeled dataset containing both positive and negative pairs. To address this, we synthesize high-quality audio from multi-track MIDI datasets containing independent instrument stems, and then extract loops to serve as positive pairs. This provides models with instrument-level information when learning compatibility. Moreover, we improve the generation of negative examples by matching the key and tempo of candidate loops, and then employing AutoMashUpper to identify incompatible loops. Creating a large dataset allows us to introduce and examine the application of Transformer architectures for addressing vertical loop compatibility. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, achieving an 18.6\% higher accuracy across multiple genres.

The paper proposes a novel approach, conducts thorough experiments, and presents the ideas and results clearly. However, reviewers do point out some limitations of this work. In particular, the (missing) invariance of the embedding to the content is the biggest limitation. As the paper tries to model the audio quality instead of the underlying audio content, this (missing) invariance is an important issue and should be discussed in the paper.

Overall, all reviewers and the independent meta-review liked the idea and contributions of this work, and recommended ""strong accept"" or ""weak accept"". One reviewer and the meta-review also recommended ""award quality"", and the other reviewers did not object this recommendation.","The paper proposes a new approach for audio effect parameter estimation from a reference recording. The approach uses a learned deep embedding that should discriminate different ""styles"" while being invariant to content, which is also the main focus of the work. The actual optimization method is mostly treated as a black box, while a comprehensive evaluation is included to test the approach for two different tasks (style classification and style transfer).

This is a relevant contribution with a good contextualization, interesting experiments, and a meaningful selection of baselines. However, there are several issues that, in my opinion, should be addressed in a possible publication.

(1) I'm not sure I understand how the pretext tasks ensures a disentanglement of (or an invariance to) the content of the audio signal. A thought experiment: If the MLP for a classifier task just learns to calculate $z_i - z_o$ in the first layer, the individual embeddings could theoretically still include all information about $x_i$ and $x_o$, respectively, while the classification can then focus on the style differences. So in a sense, $g$ is clearly encouraged to *include* information about the effects in the embedding but not discouraged to *exclude* content information? This could also explain the wide spread of cosine similarity of the Oracle condition in Fig. 5. I wonder if a different pretext task, like contrastive learning, could be beneficial here.

(2) The subjective results are quite inconclusive, which is also congruent with my impression when listening to the provided audio examples. A few observations/thoughts on the listening test:
* Why is the Oracle condition detected so inconsistently by the participants? Is there maybe a difference between individuals, so that if those who do not somewhat consistently identify the Oracle are excluded, results become more pronounced?
* I think the music examples are not very good for the purpose, since the input itself already appears to be heavily processed.
* Also, the actual task is a bit unclear from the paper. I assume that 100 means most similar to the reference and 0 means completely dissimilar, while participants where asked to consider only style and not content?

(3) The parameter estimation experiment does not take any interaction between parameters (within and across effects) into account. While this isolated experiment is an interesting starting point, it does not allow any conclusions about the ""high-dimensional loss landscape"" that is described by the embedding distance. It would be interesting to have a meaningful objective evaluation for ""bad"" local minima, which clearly seem to exist.

(4) The strategy of sampling parameter configurations for training the embedding model appears a bit odd to me. While this method makes reasonably sure that the 10 presets for each effect are quite distinct, there is no guarantee that ""perceptually diverse"" parameters are also ""perceptually meaningful"". Since some parameters are strongly interrelated (even between different plugins in the chain) and some parameters can be quite sensitive to change around their optimal working point (e.g. the delay speed around the actual tempo of the song), it may be better to train with manually tuned presets (which may be difficult to obtain to be fair)?

(5) What is the meaning of the numbers in Table 1? Accuracy? F-Measure?

(6) Is there a plan to publish code and/or pre-trained models? Especially the embedding model could be useful as a baseline or starting point for many different tasks related to audio effects.

(7) Zero-shot style classification: Could forming the prototype as the mean embedding of multiple examples from each class instead of taking just one example be more robust?

(8) I think it would have been good to reflect the focus on the learned embedding in the title of the paper. (Not sure if it can still be changed.)

(9) Some minor issues:
* How are the actual ""candidate parameters"" sampled in the CMA-ES method? Is this the mean of the population or the population member with the smallest distance to the reference?
* l. 48: ""adapt based on the external context"" is unclear to me.
* Figure 3 caption: $x_0$ should be $x_o$ in the second line.
* l. 161: to be consistent with Fig. 3, it should be $z_o$ instead of $z_r$​ here, I think.
* Eq. 3 and l. 205: Similarly, $z_i$ should be $z_o$ to be consistent with $x_o = f_c(...)$​?
* l. 295 space missing
* Table 1: While the meaning of each abbreviation can be guessed, they are not introduced anywhere (and they are in a different order than introduced in the text)
* l. 308: verb missing
* l. 342: period missing
* Table 2: How to obtain a ""correlation coefficient"" is only briefly explained in the table caption. This could be done more comprehensively in the text.
* ll. 381-382: ""as good of"" -> ""a comparable""
* Fig. 6: The grouping of the subfigures makes it a bit difficult to compare related experiments.
* Fig. 6: I assume that the grey bar is for the Input as in Fig. 5?","This paper introduces a novel system for audio effect style transfer. It thoroughly describes the method and compares it with most previous works in this field through relevant experimentation. Various audio production style transfer tasks are benchmarked, showcasing the effectiveness of the method. Real-world audio production scenarios for arbitrary effects are also explored and evaluated via a listening test.

The paper has significant contributions. An elusive audio effect metric similarity has been achieved, and gradient-free optimization is proposed as a great alternative to deal with the inherent difficulty of handling non-differentiable audio processors within learned-based systems.

I believe the paper is of great interest for this conference, and thus my overall evaluation is Strong Accept.

One limitation that could be included in the discussion is that, due to the inherent nonlinearity of various audio effects, the computation of ""Oracle"" is ill-posed. This means that when having recordings with different content, A and B, applying an audio effects chain Fx with parameters Wx won't necessarily yield the same music production style. This depends on the type of processing (or lack of) that A and B have. Fx_Wx(A) is not (always) equal to Fx_Wx(B) in terms of audio effect style similarity. Of course, the system seems to be performing well when even with this being omitted, but it could be included in the discussion to further strengthen the robustness and scientific contribution of this paper.

For further discussion, the paper could benefit from authors commenting on the effectiveness of AFx-Rep for style transfer of combinations of various audio effects, even though this metric was trained only with one effect at a time. What insights or intuition do the authors have about the reported performance of the system, as one would expect that a metric trained with one effect at a time could struggle to encode information relevant to various audio effects being applied to an audio signal?

Also, it is reported that the system struggles for parameter estimation for chorus. Is there any insight from the authors that somehow time-varying modulation effects are harder to model? The paper could also benefit from a brief clarification of this.

Finally, more details about the listening test could have been reported. What type of multiple stimulus test was performed? What question was asked to the participants? What were the listening conditions? Are any p-values relevant to the given results?

Minor comments about the paper:

- Figure 1: Could ""sim"" be replaced with AFx-Rep? This could highlight AFx-Rep as one of the main contributions of this work.

- Section 1, Line 85: Add a reference to DeepAFx-ST.

- Section 1, Line 91: The subjective listening test should be included as a contribution only if there is novelty in the subjective listening test presented, which I believe is not the case. Thus, I suggest removing this from the list of contributions.

- Section 3, Line 249: It is mentioned before that 20,000 segments were taken, but then it is said that random crops are applied as augmentations. It is not clear how these crops are being applied to the input and/or output. Is it always applied to both? What type of crops? Clarifying this could ease reproducibility of the paper.

- Section 5.1: Although the authors mention that it is difficult to draw conclusions with the audio production Style metric alone, readers would see that since ST-ITO models were trained using AFx-Rep, these models will perform better when measured via AFx-Rep. It could be interesting to also see how this evaluation goes when using the metrics that DeepAFx systems were trained with.","This work presents a self-supervised embedding trained to specifically attend to production style. This is coupled with a generic control strategy based on derivative-free optimization methods. The use of the embedding generalizes the control process, allowing it potentially to control novel sets of effects.

The proposed system is described quite clearly, employing many diagrams, which help to understand the technical models and experiments. The training and experiment procedures are described in detail.

A classification experiment proves that the system can identify production styles by the embedding, better than existing embedding approaches. Furthermore, attempts are made to mimic real production styles. This is no small task. My impression is that the parameter settings found in some of the real-world style transfer do not fit as well as they could. This, if explored, could lead to system improvements.

I have a doubt is regarding the Oracle condition in the ""Real world style transfer"" task. For instance, now I see that the reason that the Oracle has non-zero error, is because the Oracle is still being compared to the reference embedding, which is a signal with entirely different content. I believe this may hide estimation errors which may be under the threshold of inherent differences (due to content difference) between the reference and Oracle conditions.

However, wouldn't it make sense to also compare the error (both in embedding space and parameter space) of the Oracle condition versus the algorithm conditions? In this way, every small deviation in parameter estimation would be visible (in either domain), potentially shedding more light on the performance of both the optimization algorithm, and the ability of the embedding to represent small changes in parameters.

As someone interested in optimization, I wonder about the landscape of the objective function itself. This could be shown with simple example with few parameters, plotting the cosine similarity directly. Furthermore, I wonder how capable the gradient-free method chosen (CMA-ES) is really able to solve the problem.

In future work, I think more could be done to deepen the evaluation. In my opinion, the optimization method could also have been better justified. All in all, I appreciate this paper for the clarity of its approach and descriptions, for a task as challenging as automatic style transfer.","We would like to thank the reviewers for their detailed comments and suggestions. We have addressed these comments to the extent possible in the camera-ready submission. The changes include:

1) Rephrasing the discussion on previous work in Sec. 1, specifically regarding the “context-dependent” nature of audio production raised by R2 and MR. This discussion aims to underline the limitations of previous works, both rule-based and machine learning systems, which treat audio production as a one-to-one mapping. This motivates style transfer systems, which adapt based on user input.

2) Providing further details on the listening study as requested by R2. Participants were asked to rate each stimulus on a scale from 0 to 100, considering its similarity to a reference recording while ignoring differences in content and focusing on audio production.

3) Clarifying the role of the Oracle, which all reviewers raised questions about. The Oracle simply takes the input recording and applies the same parameter configuration used to create the reference. Since the input recording may have a different “starting point” from the unprocessed reference, simply applying the same parameters may not result in an ideal style transfer. This was reflected in our evaluation, with listeners sometimes rating the Oracle lower than other methods.

4) Addressing important points about the audio effect representation (AFx-Rep) raised by R2 and MR regarding its lack of invariance to content. This is true given our pretraining setup. We added details in Sec. 2 to clarify this potential limitation. However, we further motivated this choice by stating that our method is more scalable, as we can leverage any audio data, including already processed audio. This proves beneficial as it exposes our model to a wider range of effects beyond those we synthetically apply, aiding in more generalized style transfer.

5) Resolving a number of typos and rephrasing some passages based on reviewer suggestions.

251,2,3,3,Remote,FALSE,Inner Metric Analysis as a Measure of Rhythmic Syncopation,"Inner Metric Analysis (IMA) is a method for symbolic music analysis that identifies strong and weak metrical positions according to coinciding periodicities within note onsets. These periodicities are visualized with bar graphs known as metric weight and spectral weight profiles. Analyzing these profiles for the presence of syncopation has thus far required manual inspection. In this paper, we propose a simple measure using chi-squared distance for quantifying the level of syncopation found in IMA weight profiles by considering each as a distribution to be compared against (1) a uniform distribution 'nominal' weight profile, and (2) a non-uniform distribution based on beat strength. We apply this measure to the task of predicting perceptual ratings of syncopation using the Song (2014) dataset of 111 single-bar rhythmic patterns and compare its performance to seven existing models of syncopation/complexity. Our results indicate that the proposed measure based on (1) achieves a moderately high Spearman rank correlation (r_s=0.80) to all ratings and is the only single measure that reportedly works across all categories. For so-called polyrhythms in 4/4, the measure based on (2) surpasses all other models and further outperforms five models for monorhythms in 6/8 and three models for monorhythms in 4/4.",Brian Bemman,Brian Bemman (Durham University)*; Justin Christensen (The University of Sheffield),"Bemman, Brian*; Christensen, Justin",Computational musicology,"MIR fundamentals and methodology -> symbolic music processing; Musical features and properties -> rhythm, beat, tempo",,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yiNllHxKAmqCiJvBI-FrQHrt_nRxyMno/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ynvu1NYUiKg5yi1GwiZtL4tpdbDhneeD/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H5nfBlCS0ILmBV-1MTpzqmPvfKScKJSW/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RryR5iVASqN_UL-UFLDmAS-I8OTV6dQI/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xBU1uQWavrsnDfSTheY2I-DBb5Bk5dO3/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07UQ1M20JW,p3-03-inner-metric-analysis,,,,,

Against this shortcoming, we present STONE, the first self-supervised tonality estimator.

First, we train ChromaNet to regress artificial pitch transpositions between any two unlabeled musical excerpts from the same audio track, as measured as cross-power spectral density (CPSD) within the circle of fifths (CoF). We observe that this self-supervised pretext task leads KSP to correlate with tonal key signature. Based on this observation, we extend STONE to output a structured KSP of 24 logits, and introduce supervision so as to disambiguate major versus minor keys sharing the same key signature.

These segments can be mixtures for the first model, vocals for the second, and both for the third. We demonstrate that all three models are highly capable of identifying real singers.

While there were comments about the paper's clarity and title that we hope the authors will address, we feel that this paper will make a strong candidate for publication at this year's ISMIR.","This paper explores the use of contrastive learning for learning embeddings for the task of singer identification in three configurations: mixture, vocal and hybrid. The experiments show promising results, especially in the case of using the vocal model to identify real singers (as opposed to synthetic). When the instrumental stems are present in the pre-training (mixture or hybrid model) the performance is reduced. The models perform particularly worse in the case of identifying synthetic versions of the singers. These observations are explained and explored in the paper in detail. I just have a few small suggestions:

- In line 129, annotations are mentioned. However, it is unclear to me what these annotations contain and how they were used in the experiments (I’m assuming the name of the artists were used, but was there anything else?).
- In Figure 1, the Closed dataset plot is a bit too jammed together. I’d recommend plotting the accuracies of the models next to each other, rather than on top of each other.
- The observation of the non-uniform performance over musical genres (lines 322--346) would benefit from mentioning the distribution of genres in the training datasets.
- Figure 4 (as well as its caption) is a bit confusing. I’d recommend to, instead of using numbers in the caption, mention the bars themselves (e.g. “the purple bars (test/other) show … “). I’d also suggest to put the Mixture, Hybrid, Vocal as subplot titles rather than on the right.

Aside from these minimal suggestions, I believe the paper is well written and complete, making it a very good contribution to ISMIR. ","The strengths of this paper is that (a) it provides a massive dataset (with detailed description), and (b) it confirms a system trained on the real inputs alone is not capable to perform well in the synethic inputs; This implies the system should also be trained with the synthetic inputs.
Thus, the major weakness of this paper is that it triggers the reader to ask why this paper does not also examine a singing identification system trained with synthetic inputs and both (real and synthetic). 
Thus, in order to match the claim of this paper, below is the suggestion. Focus on 3 systems first (trained with (a) real, (b) synthetic, and (c) real + synthetic, and then their performance on 3 types of dataset (a) real alone, (b) synthetic alone, and (c) both real + synthetic), resulting 9 types of performance result. Given such performance results, and/or with the optional variety like genres, this paper would be more easier to read and its strengths would be strengthened. ","This paper trained the embedding of singing features by singer-level contrastive learning.
Using a singer identification model with the projector head removed, the paper reported the differences in classification  rates and characteristics between human singing voices and synthesized singing voices. NT-Xent was used for losses in embedded model training. Three types of models were trained in embedding learning: targeting separated singing voice, mixture, and their hybrid.

In an evaluation using the open dataset, the Mixture-based embedding model outperformed CLMR [36] as a conventional method. Compared to training the CLMR model, the proposed model used less than 1/20 of the number of tracks, indicating the effectiveness of singer-level sampling.

In the evaluation with the closed dataset, the paper experimented with a subset of 100 to 1000 classes. Although the performance was better with the singing voices separated, the difference in performance was small. Although it is difficult to compare performance with previous studies using inhouse datasets, this paper believe that the proposed model is at least as good. In addition, this paper showed that there can be differences in classification performance due to musical genres and difficulties in classification for singers with many songs.

Evaluations using synthetic singing datasets showed that performance was lower than when targeting real singing voices. In particular, the performance of the Mixture or Hybrid model was degraded. To investigate the cause of the performance degradation, results on the cosine similarity of the embedding vectors were also reported, such as higher similarity for the instrumental embeddings in the Mixture or Hybrid models.

The paper is well written and has adequate references. The fact that the performance of this method is equal to or better than conventional methods when targeting human singing voices and the fact that it investigates the factors that cause performance degradation are good.
Future directions following this paper include efforts to improve performance on synthetic singing voices.

The following are the issues that need to be corrected.
- Line 209: The details of the architecture for singer identification are not clear and need to be stated.
- Line 400: Figure 4 is discussed in the text without explanation and is difficult to understand. The explanation is needed. The following comments are also relevant.
- Line 405: ""the instrumental embeddings"" is the first occurrence of here, at least in the text, and it is unclear how this was obtained.
- Figure 4: It is necessary to specify which legend each of the explanations 1) to 5) corresponds to.

In addition, the following are minor comments, but these should also be corrected.
- Line 175: Regarding ""Finally, for our Hybrid model, these segments are randomly sampled from either the songs’ mixtures or their vocal stems"", it is unclear whether it means that mixture-mixture and vocal-vocal pairs are mixed in B=128, or whether mixture-vocal is also possible.
- Line 219: Regarding ""At least three tracks per singer are then used for training."", different singers have different numbers of training data?
- Figure 4: I find the notation of each legend a little hard to understand.
","Here is the summary of the changes we made to address the reviewers’ critiques:
- Global changes: we mostly replaced the words ""synthetic"" and ""spoofing"" by ""cloned"" throughout this paper. The former two words caused confusion amongst reviewers. As such, the title of the paper is now ""From Real to Cloned Singer Identification"". We also use percentages in all figures to match our other results’ reporting. Finally, the words ""music streaming service"" are replaced by Deezer now that anonymity is not needed.
- Section 3.1: we remove the term ""valid"" to describe a song, clarify that a ""unique singer"" here means a track with ""more than one singer"", highlight that ""singer"" annotations are collected to create the closed dataset, and edit out the reference to the current section.
- Section 3.2: We explicitly list the positive stem pairs that can occur during the Hybrid model’s pre-training. We also emphasise that only mixtures are used during the downstream singer identification task when the Hybrid backbone is used.
- We clarify the train and validation splits used in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
- Section 3.3: we emphasise that the classifiers have the same architecture as the projector head.
- We emphasise that the CLMR embeddings in Section 4.1 are used for both training and testing our classifiers for the real singer identification task on open datasets. We also better described the ""majority vote"" scheme used to generate classification results.
- Section 4.2: We enlarge Figure 1 for better clarity. We also introduce a table to compare our results with others in the literature. As such, the paragraph that used to do so is drastically shortened. Finally, we add a description of the genres’ distribution in Figure 2’s caption.
- Section 4.3: We clarify Figure 4’s caption by directly referring to each plot’s colour and legend.
Note that we also slightly reformulated some sections of the paper and resized some figures and tables to make everything fit in six pages!"

That is to say, the anonymity is not fully preserved.

I personally do not have conflict of interest with the authors of that paper. I have contacted meta-reviewer regarding this issue, and the meta-reviewer said that “Since you do not have a conflict of interest with the authors, you can proceed with your review”, while also encouraging me to mention this issue in the review. Therefore, I decide to mention it here.

In the remainder of this review, I will pretend that I have not read that arXiv paper.

Strengths: The new annotation of the multilingual JamendoLyrics dataset is clearly a contribution and should be credited. Also, the authors made an attempt to define general rules for readability-aware ALT and the corresponding metrics. Although I do have some concerns regarding them (see the weaknesses part), this should still be considered as a contribution.

Weaknesses: 

1) It is unclear to what extent do (and whether) the proposed evaluation metrics (WER’, F_P, F_B, etc) reflect human’s readability on the transcription. This includes two issues that need to be addressed. First, as discussed in Section 5 (particularly L408-418), the annotation of line breaks may be ambiguous. In practice, will evaluate and even optimize an ALT system with such ambiguous metrics really do more good than harm? It would be better to delve deeper into this direction, as the novel evaluation metrics are an important part of this paper. Second, the proposed evaluation metrics require the automatic transcription to strictly match the 9 general rules in Section 2. Although these rules sound reasonable, it is unclear whether an alternative set of rules (e.g., always end a line with a comma or a period) would lead to a poor formatting from the perspective of human. If this is not the case, it would be weird to punish such an alternative formatting (as what the proposed metrics do).

2) It would be better to also report the benchmark results on the original multilingual JamendoLyrics annotation. Different annotations (note that the two versions of annotations have a 11.1% WER difference) may lead to completely different evaluation results and conclusions.

3) Adding the proposed in-house ALT systems in the comparison while almost completely not discussing the method behind these systems is clearly not a good idea, as it provides basically no insight. Readers may wonder how can these in-house ALT systems achieve superior performance and want to know more information about it. But the authors provided almost no detail on it.

To sum up, this paper has both strengths and weaknesses. I consider the lack of details on the in-house ALT systems a big weakness of this paper, but I do recognize the contribution of the novel dataset annotation, along with the efforts on devising novel readability-aware ALT metrics. Therefore, I tend accept this paper.

That being said, I strongly suggest the authors provide more details on the in-house ALT systems in their camera-ready version. That would greatly improve the overall quality of this paper.
","I believe the paper is valuable for ISMIR and should be accepted. Next, I list some of the strengths and weaknesses I consider relevant:

Strengths:
1) Relevance. The paper introduces a novel benchmark for automatic lyrics transcription (ALT), emphasizing the inclusion of formatting and punctuation elements. It also proposes new evaluation metrics tailored to lyrics transcription based on industry guidelines, which adds value to the ALT field and addresses a gap in current benchmarks.

2) Well structured. The paper is well-written and organized. The title and abstract reflect the content. As far as I know, it cites and compares related work and introduces the problem well. I would also highlight the visualizations, especially those showing word edit operations, which enhance the understanding of the results. The supplementary material also helped me understand the changes in the lyrics.

3) Comprehensive error analysis. The error analysis and comparison provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current ALT systems.

Weaknesses:
1) Lack of details. The paper lacks details about the methods to replicate the results, particularly the in-house lyrics transcription methods used in the comparative analysis. I understand that they may be commercial/closed, but the absence of this information makes it challenging for peers to understand the direction of future research and development. We know there are better approaches, but we do not know what they are.

2) Metric clarification. This is not a big issue, but the description of the new WER metric is somewhat unclear. On line 175, it seems just a “case-sensitive WER,” but it also suggests a fixed pre-processing procedure. This will be solved since the implementation will be available.

3) There are minor issues in terminology and formatting, such as the inconsistency in the number of token types listed (line 196 states four but lists five) and the use of symbols like ""S.^2"". Also, P is used for the Punctuation Token and the Precision metric in section 3.2, which might confuse readers.

4) Model evaluation. The paper notes that Whisper sometimes outputs random text, but it doesn’t explore the impact of excluding these outliers on the overall results. Comparing metrics only for the word tokens would further explain their performance and whether these in-house proposals improve mainly on the newly introduced punctuation part or the traditional tokens.

5) Unknown details on variants. The authors' system v1 performed poorly on the SWD dataset, while v2 outperformed others, but it lacks an explanation for this improvement, leaving readers without insight into the advancements made.

Final comment:
While I listed more weaknesses than strengths, I believe the paper significantly contributes to the ALT field, providing a benchmark and metrics that address aspects of lyrics transcription that traditional metrics overlook. Despite the lack of information on the in-house models and minor inconsistencies, the overall quality of the work justifies recommending the paper for acceptance.","— RESUME —
This paper extends the LBD ""JAM-ALT: A FORMATTING-AWARE LYRICS TRANSCRIPTION BENCHMARK"" presented at ISMIR last year. It includes a revised version of the JamendoLyrics dataset, a common dataset used for evaluating automatic lyrics transcription (ALT), to align with industry guidelines. Additionally, the authors have suggested adapting two well-known metrics to better capture the specific aspects of lyrics that are not accounted for in speech transcription. Finally, several ATMs are compared, discussing their limitations and errors.

— SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION —
Their main scientific contribution is the revised version of the JamendoLyrics dataset, which now aligns with industry standards. This will help to more accurately assess the performance of current ALT models. The newly proposed metrics provide better insights into the type of errors models do, enabling the development of improved models. In addition, they have benchmarked most of the current models. Their analysis is useful for understanding their performance and limitations.

— REVISED JAMENDO AND METRICS —

The paper first sets out formatting guidelines for lyrics based on industry standards. Then, it introduces a revised version of the JamendoLyrics dataset that adheres to these new standards. Moreover, the authors propose a modified version of the word error rate (WER) metric to accommodate case-sensitive errors, along with a method for measuring punctuation and line break errors. This provides a more comprehensive way to quantify ALT model accuracy. The most interesting part is that previous metrics did not take into account the line/section breaks, which are crucial for music, since they convey rhyme, rhythm, and structure in popular Western music.


- BENCHMARK - 
In this section, the authors evaluate the most common ALT models using their revised version of JamendoLyrics. This section reads more like a survey or benchmark paper, comparing different models rather than highlighting the benefits of the revised dataset and proposed metrics. Especially when it feels like the authors try to ""sell"" their in-house model, which is not explained whatsoever or cited. In fact, most of the trends observed (when comparing models) in the WER' are the same for WER, and all the analysis in section 4.1 is based on WER. The authors do not compare the performance obtained from the same model for the previous version of JamendoLyrics to assess the need to use their version rather than the previous one, for instance as an example it would have been more interesting to spot misleading high performances that do not reflect the real structure of a song when missing line breaks(?). The comparison between the revised version and the old version is one of the most interesting aspects of Table 1. This demonstrates that the main issue with the previous version is primarily the line break annotations (hence the section annotation). This is crucial for lyrics because these aspects are linked to rhyme, meter, rhythm, and musical phrasing. I would have expected a bit more analysis in this direction, i.e. in comparing the performance when using both versions of the dataset, rather than such a detailed analysis of the current models. For example, the use of source separation and its impact on the performance, while interesting, seems to be beyond the scope of the paper, it doesn't change anything in trends and simply boosts or decreases the metrics by a factor. Instead, they should have focused on the dataset and the metrics. This is why, I greatly appreciate section 4.2, which analyses the different models' error types with respect to the proposed metrics. However, the first part of this analysis (Figure 3) could have been done almost independently (except for the 'case' error) without the new dataset and proposed metrics. 

The Schubert Winterisse Dataset section accentuates the feeling of disconnection from the previous sections and a swift transition into a full benchmark/survey paper. It is mostly a section to compare the different ALT rather than a showcase of the benefits of using the new metrics and has no reference to their proposed guideline nor their dataset.


— FINAL COMMENT —
The paper has two faces. The first part presents the authors' revised version of JamendoLyrics and their metrics to capture common errors not identified by speech transcription metrics and related to important token types for lyrics. The second part focuses on benchmarking ALT models, this part is longer than the first part. Both of them are valuable and will provide useful insight to the community, but the second part feels disconnected and not well aligned with the title and abstract of the paper. I expected an analysis that emphasizes the benefits of the revised version and demonstrates how evaluating the previous version could lead to misunderstandings about the real performance of an ATL. After reading the paper, I am still unsure whether a model that had good results in the previous Jamendo produces a particular type of mistake that I can now spot with this new version. (It is clear that the line breaks and paragraphs weren't there before but it's never pointed out in the paper). On the other hand, the benefit of the new evaluation metrics is clear, since they directly indicate the type of error with respect to each token type, especially the line break and paragraphs.

I think it also misses an opportunity to provide a tool to verify if a given set of lyrics follows the guidelines or not to assess its quality, as well as an initiative/encouragement to adapt other datasets.","- We now only evaluate the latest version (v3) of our in-house model, as we agree that it is not warranted to have two versions of it in the paper.
- As we are not able to provide further details about our model, we instead reduced mentions of our model in the text of the paper.
- We have better separated fully open-source models from proprietary ones in our results tables, and highlighted the best open-source results.
- Following the suggestions of R1 and R4, we have added evaluation of the same models on the original JamendoLyrics dataset (Section 4.2, Table 2).
- We removed speculations/details about Whisper and OWSM in Section 4.1, deemed out of scope.
- We updated the discussion, addressing a limitation pointed out by R1.
- We updated the first paragraph of Section 3 to clarify our goals in designing the metrics in response to R1.
- We now better introduce Section 4.4, presenting results on the SWD dataset.
- We fixed/clarified minor issues pointed out by R3.
- We added the benchmark name (Jam-ALT) and a link to the data and code.

To address other comments:

> R3: “Comparing metrics only for the word tokens would further explain their performance and whether these in-house proposals improve mainly on the newly introduced punctuation part or the traditional tokens.”

WER only takes word tokens into account, as mentioned in the paper.

> R1: “It is unclear to what extent do (and whether) the proposed evaluation metrics (WER’, F_P, F_B, etc) reflect human’s readability on the transcription. [...]”

Note that our goal was to design metrics that are generally applicable, and not tightly bound to the dataset or specific formatting rules. We now mention this in Sections 3 and 5.

We agree with the point about punishing different formatting choices, and we now mention this more clearly in the discussion."

Despite the promising results they have shown for zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, closer inspection of the embeddings is needed. This paper evaluates the inherent zero-shot properties of joint audio-text spaces for the case-study of instrument recognition. We present an evaluation and analysis of two-tower systems for zero-shot instrument recognition, and a detailed analysis of the properties of the pre-projected and joint embedding spaces. Our findings suggest that audio encoders alone demonstrate good quality, while challenges remain within the text encoder or joint space projection. Specifically, two-tower systems exhibit sensitivity towards specific words, favoring generic prompts over musically informed ones. Despite the large size of textual encoders, they do not yet leverage additional textual context or infer instruments accurately from their descriptions. Lastly, a novel approach for quantifying the semantic meaningfulness of the textual space leveraging an existing instrument ontology is proposed.

Please take into careful consideration the reviewer's comments to improve this work for the camera ready version.","Summary:

The paper discusses the applicability of multimodal audio-text for musical instrument classification. Such models enable a user to measure the 'distance' between an audio clip and a text prompt. The authors determine that such models are suitable for tasks such as instrument classification due to the scarcity of large datasets containing many labeled instruments as well as the fluidity of the output label space, i.e., new instruments might be needed to be added to a trained classifier.
The authors aim to assess the zero-shot capability of such models for the task, specifically probing the importance of the text prompt used, and the power of so-called pre-joint and joint embedding spaces of three models. Through various experiments, they find that models do not utilize text context instead focusing on the label word within the input prompt. They also find that the text branch of these models perform significantly poorly compared to the audio-only branch. The conclusion of this study is that alignment between text and audio is lacking in the chosen music-text joint models and should be the focus of future research.

Strengths:
- The paper is discussing research questions that are well aligned with latest trends of machine learning research. Multimodal models are being heavily studied and there is a surge of audio/music/text models. The findinds in this paper seem to be helpful in guiding future direction of research in the space.
- The authors have done a good job organizing the paper and covering various research questions that arise when evaluating the zero-shot capabilities of the models.

Weaknesses:
- I am not sure why the authors refer to the two ""musically informed"" prompts as such. I do not really see any semantic difference between the MusCALL prompt and the #1 prompt.
- I believe the study would have been complete if the authors chose to include one of the experiments that has been left as future work: using some kind of prompt upsampling/augmentation to inject stochasticity to the training of such models. It is well-known that such methods improve the generalizability of these models and thus the findings of this paper might potentially have changed significantly using more robustly trained models.","The paper compares three different algorithms for two-tower multimodal systems which produce a joint audio and text embedding based on text and audio encoders. Although the data set used is rather simple and not very large, the authors justify very well its selection.

The paper is well written, all necessary literature is discussed. After some backgrounds into methodology several experiments are described in detail and supported with figures. Also the problematic issues of the used system are reported.

However, the statistical evaluation of experiments can be done in a more thorough way: e.g., statistics over prompts for n different instruments could be reported with standard deviations (cf. Figure 2) and also statistical tests could be applied for some quantitative measurements / comparison of prompts and methods. For instance, the statement that ""MusCALL prompt .. leads to the highest top-1 accuracy"" is not clear: for Music/Speech CLAP it can be observed, but for Music CLAP the values seem to be very close, and for MusCALL it is even below the most of other prompts. ","The authors provide a thorough, well-organized analysis of the pre-joint and joint audio-text embedding spaces in the context of musical instrument recognition. Thanks for your contributions!

Strengths:
- Related work section is very strong and covers all of the bases, which is especially great in an analysis paper!
- Very clear motivation and setup of experimentation.
- Figures 3 and 4 were really interesting and illustrated some of your key discussion points well!

Comments:
- Figure 2 was hard to digest. (1) The inclusion of the joint and pre-joint audio does not fit as the figure mostly illustrates prompt comparisons and while it states in 3.3 that it will be explained exactly what these columns mean in 3.4, I never quite could understand what this represented? (2) Could be helpful to have the prompts on the same page as this figure or even somewhere in the figure, as looking at ""prompt 1...etc"" means nothing to the reader without flipping back and forth
- I think more qualitative analysis and discussion could enhance your analysis even further. The discussion is mostly centered on metrics for instrument recognition (which also makes sense), but it would be great to have a bit more discussion of what you really saw (qualitatively) in the recognition when using the different embeddings, similar to the discussion you have surrounding the importance of prompt engineering in the text encoder. 
- The metric for semantic meaningfulness based on instrument ontology is quite interesting in theory, but Figure 5 shows that across systems the results were quite similar. Is there a way the metric could be modified to emphasize wider spreads in some way?
","Apart from problems residing in arguments used or claims, most of the critique was into not providing more experimentation and testing some of the hypothesis/proposals left for future work. We need to highlight that the main topic of this paper is to evaluate the SOTA two-tower systems and establish a baseline (or absence). Our results alongside the performance reported from most of the authors for the two-tower systems proposed provide evidence that we are far from properly utilizing extra modalities. As a novel step, we tried to pinpoint the cause of this issue and found that the text branch or alignment is the main issue, as the audio encoders perform greatly. The 6 pages format was a hindering aspect to further provide more experiments and test some of our hypothesis for potential improvements over the problems stated and this is mainly the reason why we abstained from including results as they would decrese the value of this paper as an evaluation one.

Figure 2 was criticized but we argue that it clearly show the following two takeaways: Changing prompts lead to almost erratic performance changes and using Audio only information almost doubles the performance.

We generally included pretty bold claims, and in some cases unjustified (as claiming that we have an issue with using two-tower systems for multi-label zero-shot classification). We changed the phrasing to imply that this is just a stepping stone and we cannot have a strong conclusion given those experiments. Despite this fact, we still think its a great way of establishing a more thorough way of evaluating Deep Learning systems and sheding more light in the reasons why these systems might fail apart from presenting a table with metrics."

1. Restrictions due to the oversimplistic binary meter model.
2. With PLP as a basis, how does the system performance depend on genre, tempo stability. Also, more detail on the PLP parameters must be provided.
As meta-reviewer I would also add that you should explain how statistical significance was judged. ","This paper describes a contrastive pretraining method for beat tracking. The methods are highly novel. The use of a PLP for contrastive sample mining is very interesting and seemingly effective. The experiments are comprehensive on several datasets on both few-shot and full fine-tuning tasks.

Some questions:

Methodology:
The introduction of PLP helps solve the task of mining positive samples in beat tracking. The idea is highly novel and interesting. There seem to be some concerns about PLP: (1) How accurate it is for different genres? Will it be reasonably accurate if the music has rapid local tempo changes? (2) How likely are they to form binary-segmented tatums (i.e., 8-th notes) instead of ternary ones (i.e., 12-th notes)? 1-2 lines of description of preliminary experiments would help people get more sense of the feature.

Experiments:
Section 4.5: ""Instead of ... of layer sequences."" What is the weighted sum of layer sequences? Also, why choose a different fine-tuning scheme? Is linear probing not as good? Or, is there a specified reason?

Related works:
The idea of utilizing the binary rhythmic structure for self-supervised learning was previously used in [1].

The methodology of the paper could be beneficial to other rhythm-related downstream tasks, or even general pretraining models for MIR. Considering the novelty of the method and the concrete results, I recommend a strong acceptance with the possibility of an award nomination.

","This work proposed a novel scheme to pretrain a network in a self-supervised manner using contrastive loss and finetune the network for beat tracking with few-shot learning; the results are comparable to the SOTA supervised models and nicely demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. Considering that there are not many works for self-supervised beat tracking, and that the proposed methods are novel and perform promising, I originally would like to give a strong accept. However, due to the issues I mentioned in the reusable insight section and the following minor flaws, I have to weaken my acceptance to this work. 

- Line 173: What does this binary structure mean here?
- Line 182:This description is repeated several times in different ways; but the unit of the distance is not clear until this sentence. For example, Line 13,  line 165-169.
- Line 409-416: The observation that the proposed model performs much better on Hainsworth is worthy of more discussions. Is it because that the model learns different knowledges or because of some special properties of Hainsworth? Without discussion, the reusable insight of this improvement is limited.
- Line 462: rewrite the sentence: "" where our the selection of anchor, positive and negative peaks derives from a Predominant Local Pulse function.""
- Line 236: alpha = 4 tu?


","The paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) approach for rhythm analysis and tackles few-shot beat tracking. The learning strategy is based on contrastive learning and the pre-text task samples anchor, positive, and negative points from Predominant Local Pulse (PLP) maxima. These samples are used to train and encoder to contrast observations at beats (actually multiples of the tatum) from those that are not, using unlabelled data from FMA, MTT and MTG-Jamendo datasets. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned with just a few annotated examples (i.e. few-shot) on the beat-tracking task. Results show the proposed approach outperforms an existing SSL method (Zero-Note Samba) and yiedls competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art supervised models.

The paper is well written and organized (despite some minor corrections listed below) and is a very good contribution to ISMIR. 

The proposal has some clear limitations, though. First, the binary structure hypothesis does not hold for many music styles. Moreover, the sampling from the PLP makes the asumption that peaks are synchronized with 8-th notes and that the tracks are in 4/4. The authors acknowledge these are over-simplistic assumptions (line 174), but I encourage them to add some comments on how the proposal could be extended to non-binary music structures. One could think of other sampling strategies that may account for other meters, but this would probably require meter classification. 

In adddition, relying on the PLP function has some drawbacks. Particularly, it can be noisy when there are tempo fluctuations or sudden tempo changes. The proposal deals with this kind of situation by filtering out tracks where the inter-peak distance of the PLP function is not almost constant (lines 375-380). Then, time-varing tempo is synthetically introduced through data augmentation during training.  This raises the question of to what extent the model can deal with tempo fluctuations within a song, so some insights on that would be welcome. 

Experimental results confirm that the pre-trained model after fine-tuning can produce very competitive results, which seems to confirm that for the music datasets considered the assumptions are correct. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to test the model with music for which the over-simplistic assumptions do not hold and perform a detailed analysis of the results.  

There is no supplementary material, so I could not access the code, but the paper indicates that it will be available. It would be important that the pre-trained models and the code for the experiments are available to enhance scientific reproducibility.

Minor corrections

It seems that beat and tatum are never defined. A short clarification would be nice. 

Line 35 - ""at most a few thousands ..."" refers to data, so something is missing here.

Note that there is an error in Figure 2. The time corresponding to yp should be in Ya, which means should be ya+ix\alpha, but in the diagram of Figure 2 it is located in between ya+2\alpha and ya+3\alpha.

293,2,4,11,San Francisco,FALSE,Improved symbolic drum style classification with grammar-based hierarchical representations,"Deep learning models have become a critical tool for analysis and classification of musical data. These models operate either on the audio signal, e.g. waveform or spectrogram, or on a symbolic representation, such as MIDI. In the latter, musical information is often reduced to basic features, i.e. durations, pitches and velocities. Most existing works then rely on generic tokenization strategies from classical natural language processing, or matrix representations, e.g. piano roll. In this work, we evaluate how enriched representations of symbolic data can impact deep models, i.e. Transformers and RNN, for music style classification. In particular, we examine representations that explicitly incorporate musical information implicitly present in MIDI-like encodings, such as rhythmic organization, and show that they outperform generic tokenization strategies. We introduce a new tree-based representation of MIDI data built upon a context-free musical grammar. We show that this grammar representation accurately encodes high-level rhythmic information and outperforms existing encodings on the GrooveMIDI Dataset for drumming style classification, while being more compact and parameter-efficient.",Léo Géré,Léo Géré (Cnam)*; Nicolas Audebert (IGN); Philippe Rigaux (Cnam),"Géré, Léo*; Audebert, Nicolas; Rigaux, Philippe",MIR tasks -> automatic classification,Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR; Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR -> representations of music; MIR fundamentals and methodology -> symbolic music processing; Musical features and properties -> representations of music,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ylnqtKDbEBOQxFsCRlpaGPuK-c3RAPH/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8zWhXRLWjWukMzDXT6DLO8UKfg8IaO4/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-G3JwglvXOhAmH8jcKVcKVuC6FRoSND/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/14RvMqnf57mymZFZ5vRsTRTR4aCVFpJ5Z/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mu5h0nYN0QFGlmtpty8vMscvMIXyRI5T/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07U9F8BYB1,p4-11-improved-symbolic-drum,"The discussion of this paper was by and large positive. There is some question of the generality of the representation, and whether the rules extracted by qparse are sufficiently general to allow lots of different rhythmic possibilities. Its proximity to the qparse implementation is also concerning. The authors should spend some time improving their paper long the several directions identified by the reviewers.","Summary: The authors develop a new tree-based MIDI representation of drumming data (linear rhythmic tree) and test it with 3 other representational models and present their results.  The LRT does the best.

Strengths: This is a very good paper with reproducible results.  The major novel idea is the LRT.  I like that the new model is tested against other models as well, both with LSTMs and transformers.

Weaknesses: Nothing is incredibly ground-breaking or earth-shattering. The results are incremental.","This paper uses grammatical representation of MIDI files for style classification. Experimental results show that comparable or significantly better performance is achieved using less model parameters. The description and results are convincing, but explaining more details could make this paper better.

- Line #165: Please define “optimization-based music transcription systems”. Does it mean “a music transcription system that invokes optimization algorithm”? If yes, then deep models (line 168) are one type of such system, but in this sentence (While designed …) they are viewed as different.

- Line #381: Please give specs of CPU and GPU. Elapsed times are not meaningful enough if specs are unknown.
","This paper presents a new representation for quantized MIDI files based on principles from a library called qparse. The approach is very interesting and the paper well-written. However, the paper also raises a number of questions that were left partly unanswered:
- Partial Evaluation: The task is evaluated based on a single specific task without considering alternative approaches. The authors focus solely on this task, comparing only their own results. Evaluating the method against an established task and existing approaches would significantly strengthen the case for introducing a novel data representation.
- Hard to interpret experiment tables: Table 1 contains a configuration study but the choice of bars and parameter size is not very intuitive. The choice of bars across tokenizations and models for example seems a bit arbitrary. Figure 4 and 5 also follow the same ambiguity, and raise the question of why the proposed representation using a transformer is compared to an LSTM, I would argue that some justification is missing.
- Relevance of the Task: The task chosen for evaluation is too simplistic to effectively demonstrate a completely new representation, raising doubts about the general applicability of the new representation.
- Generality of the representation: The new representation is very simple and clear but it does not cover all (or even broadly enough) musical durations such as composite durations, dotted notes, tuplets other than triplets, tied notes, etc.","Thank you all for your reviews. Please find below the changes we have made to take them into account.

As proposed, we modified the title to reflect the fact that we evaluate our approach on drum music.

We added a reference to get further insight on formal grammar and context-free grammar in the related section.

We clarified the Figure 2 and the associated text in order to make it more easily understandable.

We also explained that model hyperparameters, including depth and width of the architectures, as well as the number of bars considered for each encoding were obtained using a hyperparameter search on the validation set.

Furthermore, we also added a note explaining that while we are indeed limited by some of qparse limitations, we aim at evaluating the rhythmic tree representation, regardless of how it has been built. Researching more robust ways of building such trees would be suited for some follow-up research.

In the supplementary material, we added some details on the grammar we used, and how the tree is built.

As proposed, we also added the confusion matrix of one of the models trained with the best architecture in the supplementary material, with some succinct interpretation."

However, automatic analysis of musical dynamics for singing voice has received limited attention partly due to the scarcity of suitable datasets and a lack of clear evaluation frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology for dataset curation. Employing the proposed methodology, we compile a dataset comprising 509 musical dynamics annotated singing voice  performances, aligned with 163 score files, leveraging state-of-the-art source separation and alignment techniques. The scores are sourced from the OpenScore Lieder corpus of romantic-era compositions, widely known for its wealth of expressive annotations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we train a multi-head attention based CNN model with varying window sizes to evaluate the effectiveness of estimating musical dynamics. We explored two distinct perceptually motivated input representations for the model training: log-Mel spectrum and bark-scale based features. For testing, we manually curate another dataset of 25 musical dynamics annotated performances in collaboration with a professional vocalist. We conclude through our experiments that bark-scale based features outperform log-Mel-features for the task of singing voice dynamics prediction.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce Diff-MST, a framework comprising a differentiable mixing console, a transformer controller, and an audio production style loss function. By inputting raw tracks and a reference song, our model estimates control parameters for audio effects within a differentiable mixing console, producing high-quality mixes and enabling post-hoc adjustments. Moreover, our architecture supports an arbitrary number of input tracks without source labelling, enabling real-world applications.

In the field of Music Emotion Recognition (MER), recent efforts have been made to predict listeners' time-varying perceived emotions using machine-learning models. However, interpreting these models has been challenging due to their black-box nature. To increase the explainability of models for subjective emotional experiences, we focus on composers’ emotional intentions. Our study aims to determine which audio features effectively predict both composers' time-varying emotions and listeners' perceived emotions. Seven composers performed 18 piano improvisations expressing three types of emotions (joy/happiness, sadness, and anger), which were then listened to by 36 participants in a laboratory setting. Both composers and listeners continuously assessed the emotional valence of the music clips on a 9-point scale (1: 'very negative' to 9: 'very positive'). Linear mixed-effect models analysis revealed that listeners significantly perceived the composers' intended emotions. Regarding audio features, the RMS was found to modulate the degree to which the listener's perceived emotion resembled the composer's emotion across all emotions. Moreover, the significant audio features that influenced this relationship varied depending on the emotion type.

322,3,5,17,San Francisco,FALSE,RNBert: Fine-Tuning a Masked Language Model for Roman Numeral Analysis,"Music is plentiful, but labeled data for music theory tasks like roman numeral analysis is scarce. Self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled data is therefore a promising means of improving performance on these tasks, especially because, during pretraining, a model may be expected to acquire latent representations of musical abstractions like keys and chords. However, existing deep learning models for roman numeral analysis have not used pretraining, instead training from scratch on labeled data, while conversely, pretrained models for music understanding have generally been applied to sequence-level tasks not involving explicit music theory, like composer or genre classification. In contrast, this paper applies pretraining methods to a music theory task by fine-tuning a masked language model, MusicBERT, for roman numeral analysis.

We encourage the authors to expand this is any revision of the paper.,"The idea of this paper is simple: using a pre-trained model for symbolic music, MusicBERT, to improve the performance for roman numeral analysis. Although it achieves better performances than previous approaches, I am looking for a in-depth discussion on the choice of MusicBERT: why it instead of other similar models like MidiBERT-Piano and others? This is an essential question that the authors need to answer in the camera-ready version (if it comes to that) and even better, if authors conduct a comparative study on how the choice of different pre-trained models (including MusicBERT) affects the performance of roman numeral analysis. Althought the latter may require extra experiments that won't make it to this paper, I strongly suggest the author at least present a reasonable review on pre-trained models for symbolic music and the choice of MusicBERT. Without it, this work won't be considered a solid contribution to the community.

Other than that, this paper is generally easy to follow but lacks polishing in some occasions. For example, the formatting of the references is bad, and the caption of Table 1 is overly short without meaningful descriptions, hence lacking a period in the end. Also, a model diagram illustrating its training and inference will be helpful, especially on the post-processing part in Section 3.7, which I find difficult to follow. Although it is nice to open-source the code, as indicated in Footnote 1, the authors should be more discreet about anonymity as the username embedded in the github URL will easily give away the identity of this submission. There are also grammatical errors shown as follow. 

Line 85: [14] add -> [14] adds
Line 103: including by -> including

Overall, I will give weak accept for this paper, on the condition that (1) the authors work on the explanation of why MusicBERT is chosen and (2) polish its content further to make it a competent ISMIR publication.  ","Overall, this is a very good, precisely written, scientifically sound, and interesting paper. The general approach of finetuning for token classification itself is certainly not the most novel idea. However, the authors carefully consider and describe all parts involved to achieve that, from the dataset, preprocessing, and tokenization to postprocessing and other interesting tweaks (e.g. key conditioning). I was pleased to have each doubt that arose immediately answered in the paper through the side-experiments mentioned and ablations that were presented. Each part of the methodology is precisely described and design choices are justified from both a scientific and music-theoretic perspective. Results are also carefully and interestingly described from these lenses.

The writing is clear and precise and the paper is organized well. It is perhaps slightly unusual to see the experimental setup subsections in this order (usually I'd expect to move from model to data), but it works well and, importantly, there are no redundancies or ambiguities.

It would have been interesting to see a bit more work (and perhaps detail in the paper) in the choice of finetuning. There isn't adequate justification about why the first 9 layers of BERT are frozen specifically. It would have been interesting to experiment with different layer freezing, and even parameter- and resource-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA. All this is particularly interesting because of existing indications about how different the information between transformers' layers can be. In ""Comparative Layer-Wise Analysis of Self-Supervised Speech Models” by Pasad et al., for example, layer similarity of voice models with phonemes and words is computed, yielding interesting results about the ""location"" of relevant features. It's not trivial to adapt this framework to symbolic music and RN analysis, but it would certainly be interesting.

It would have been nice (and it's still possible for the camera-ready) to acknowledge some compute-related information of your experiments, such as the finetuning and inference cost, in relation to existing work (at least through the parameter counts).

The citations are not well formatted and would need to be fixed for the camera ready. Please only include arxiv/zenodo versions if the paper isn't published already in a venue.

The paper is well-written, and the results are highly promising, while also addressesing important questions regarding automatic Roman numeral analysis. Namely, the authors address the issue of potential multiple valid interpretations of a given segment or analysis.

However, there are several areas that would require minor corrections and refinement:

1. Missing Publication Years in References: A very important point is that, all references lack the publication year, which is essential for proper citation and a high standard of an academic proceedings paper.

2. Inconsistency in References: A more minor point is the presentation of publishing venues for proceedings which are abbreviated or in a couple of case missing completely, for example pay attention to ""in ISMIR"": -> should be ""in Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR)"" and likewise for others. In summary, it is highly suggested to the authors to fix the references section. 

3. Caution against Overstated Claims: Strong claims should be tempered. For instance, the assertion in footnote 8 implying the potential incorrectness of a human annotator's analysis should be approached with caution. Multiple valid interpretations can exist for a segment or Roman numeral, as highlighted in Section 4.2. Hence, it's advisable for the authors to avoid absolute statements regarding the absolute correctness of any single analysis.

4. Standardization of Terminology: The capitalization of ""Roman numeral"" throughout the text varies. For consistency, it should be ""Roman numeral,"" with ""Roman"" capitalized as it serves as an adjective referencing a place of origin.

5. Reevaluation of Key Prediction Triviality: The claim that predicting the key is trivial warrants reevaluation. While the paper suggests high accuracy in key prediction, it's crucial to consider the broader context. Many existing approaches, such as AugmentedNet, ChordGNN, and PKSpell, do not achieve near-perfect accuracy in predicting local keys or key signatures. Supporting this claim with evidence from publications demonstrating similar high accuracies would strengthen its validity. Alternatively, softening the claim to reflect the complexity and challenges associated with key prediction would be more prudent.

Addressing these points will enhance the clarity, strength, and credibility of the paper.","I respond to the main reviewer comments below. The paper has been updated to address issues of formatting, grammar, etc., without further comment here.

# Reviewer 1

> I am looking for a in-depth discussion on the choice of MusicBERT

I added an explanation of why I chose to use MusicBERT. I agree that a comparative evaluation of MusicBERT with other models would be useful, but that will await future work. In any case, the main contribution of this paper is the general approach of using a pre-trained masked language model for token-level music theory tasks, which to our knowledge has not previously been applied to Roman numeral analysis or any similar task.

> a model diagram illustrating its training and inference will be helpful

Unfortunately we do not have space to add this while remaining within the space constraints of an ISMIR paper.

# Reviewer 2

> There isn't adequate justification about why the first 9 layers of BERT are frozen specifically. It would have been interesting to experiment with different layer freezing, and even parameter- and resource-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA.

I now state how and why I chose to freeze the first 9 layers. I agree that LoRA is worth trying, but that will await future work.

> acknowledge some compute-related information of your experiments, such as the finetuning and inference cost, in relation to existing work (at least through the parameter counts).

Thank you for mentioning this oversight. I added parameter counts.

# Reviewer 3

>  The claim that predicting the key is trivial warrants reevaluation.

The reviewer may have misunderstood one small claim. Key prediction is not trivial. What I suggest is ""trivial"" is the task of predicting a spelled key (like ""Db major"") given

- an unspelled key (like ""1 major"" for a major key with tonic pc 1), and
- spelled pitch inputs (like Db5 and Ab5) rather than unspelled inputs (like MIDInums 61 and 68).

I revised the passage in question to clarify it with examples."

Our transition model includes a tunable parameter to control the time-continuity of corpus grains, and our observation model allows users to prioritize how quickly windows change to match the target. Because the computational complexity of the system is independent of the corpus size, our system scales to corpora that are hours long, which is an important feature in the age of vast audio data collections. Within The Concatenator module itself, composers can vary grain length, fit to target, and pitch shift in real time while reacting to the sounds they hear, enabling them to rapidly iterate ideas.

Reviewer #3 emphasized that this framework has a lot of potential in other MIR tasks as well. At the same time, all reviewers pointed out that the evaluation part is weak. Specifically, the experiment was conducted on a small dataset in limited music scenarios. The results are presented qualitatively without model comparison. Nevertheless, all reviewers are generally in favor of this paper, mainly because of its potential impact on the ISMIR community.","The paper is well written and clear. I'm not an expert on how to analyze temporal alignment and synchronization between musician in an ensemble, but it was not difficult to follow the technical details, also thankfully for the clarity of the exposition. The Kalman Filter is ubiquitous and it has been proven effective also in studying how precise temporal synchronization between performers in a musical ensemble is achieved. The phase correction strength seems to be a good indicator for knowing which instruments are the leaders, and which are the followers. The results show on the Op. 74 no. 1 by Joseph Haydn are quite impressive to me. As I mentioned I'm not an expert on this very specific topic, so, unfortunately I do not know the literature, and nor the state of the art of the syncrony analysis. Give that, I red the paper with pleasure and it flows like a familiar topic to me. It would be nice to have a thorough evaluation also on other music ensemble examples. But I understand that the dataset can be a problem since this is a very specific ground truth that is not simple to obtain. Moreover, I can imagine some implication also in other MIR topics, like score followers and also generative models can use the phase correction gain to model the ""humanity"" of the timing of a computer generated music.","The paper presents a linear model for ensemble synchronization using Kalman Filter. It essentially uses time-dependent version of ADAM, where instead of bGLS model, KF is used.

The paper evaluates the model using a simulation of normal performance, tempo change and deadpan condition, and shows that the filtered state variables seems to be consistent with the nature of the pieces.

The model is really exciting, bridging the gap between music cognition and interactive music systems.  It will be immsensely useful for automatic accompaniment systems, beat tracking systems, or any system in which timing interaction between human musicians (or machines) are useful.

One issue is the evaluation, where the authors only provide the trajectory of the estimated parameters to describe why the model makes sense qualitatively.  I understand that the result seems to make sense, but I would have like to see for example comparison with other methods for parameter estimation.  For example, in all cases it takes about 20-30 onsets for the parameters to converge from the initial value.  Are these because the process noise is so small for alpha, or are these because the correction values really change after starting the performance?  

There are a few questions that I found might be beneficial for the authors to discuss in the paper.

1. My understanding is that linear models for phase/period synchronization has constraints that model relationship between parameters like timekeeper and motor variance, the constraints of which necessitates the use of bGLS algorithm instead of simple regression models.   In the proposed method, however, the model is solved using KF, meaning such hard constraints cannot be handled.  Without using more elaborate variants like Unscented KF, do the filtered estimates ""make sense"" from music cognition perspective?  In other words, is the proposed method just a convenient state-space model for music ensemble modeling, or is it something that can provide insights to music cognition studies using ADAM?  Please discuss some limitations regarding the parameter estimates, if any.
2. Is smoothing the period/phase correction useful?  Fig. 1 seems that there is an excessive smoothing of the parameters, which hides the underlying interaction that is going on.  It would have been interesting to see how the correction parameters alpha and beta vary by changing the process noise of the corresponding parameters, or perhaps considering them independent of each other and using multiple takes of the same piece to identify the parameters.

A comment

- In the evaluation, all of the smoothed estimates start with 0.25 which I presume is a hardcoded initial value.   I believe if the initial state covariance estimate is set to a very large value, the smoothed state estimates will have less influence on the choice of the initial value.","This paper builds on the phase correction model and period correction model presented in [9-11], discussing how these can be optimized using Kalman filter assumptions. While a significant portion of the paper is dedicated to deriving equations, it is disappointing that the advantages of the methodology are not sufficiently demonstrated through experiments. Specifically, there is a lack of discussion on how this approach could be applied to general music scenarios. Additionally, it is unclear whether this methodology can only be applied to phase correction or period correction models, leaving the paper's significance in general synchronization contexts uncertain.","In a nutshell, the suggestions pointed out by the reviewers and the meta-reviewer were related to two main points: improve the clarity of the text and strengthen the experimental part of the paper. The first point was addressed by two modifications: writing a small sentence at the beginning of Section 4 indicating that the matrices there described aim to recover the proposed model (Eqs. 5-8) via Eqs. 9 and 10; regenerating Figure 1 with different markers, and not only different colors, to improve the readability of the paper on its black and white printed version. As to the second point (improving the experimental part of the paper), unfortunately the limitation of space does not allow us to properly discuss any other additional experiment. However, we acknowledge the issues raised by the reviewers and the meta-reviewer on the last paragraph of Section 5, indicating their resolution in future works."

The dataset will be undoubtedly useful for future MIR work on Carnatic music. However, the annotation and validation analyses seemed to have been completed in a hurry.  Please go through the comments by the 3 reviewers who have pointed out several aspects that need attention in order to make this a truly valuable resource.","The paper proposes Saraga Carnatic 2.0: a large multimodal open data collection for analyzing Carnatic music. The paper reads well; however, the organization of the Experiments section could be reworked as some of the content is parallel and does not adhere to a causal flow. The authors refer to the existing dataset by 3 different names: Saraga, original Saraga, and Saraga1.0, which should be consistent. Innuendos such as “nature of Carnatic music” (line 459) may be avoided as this is a loaded statement, and a Spleeter model to learn such nuance while preserving the knowledge warrants more detailed discourse on the process.

I have reservations about the argument that melodic motif annotations are unreasonable for manifold reasons. On the one hand, the authors acknowledge improving motif recognition as a useful task (line 188) and identify regions of repeated melodic motifs (line 312). On the other hand, advocating the lack of importance of the annotation task is counterintuitive. Most newly added ragas have only 1 occurrence, as evident from Figure 1. In the absence of several and balanced instances of a raga class, it is imperative that this dataset is not suitable for a raga classification task. This defeats the claim of new raga additions scaling the same (line 187).

The video analysis of the gesture modeling is well-written. However, the demo video shows that the performer keeps the meter by clapping gesture, with one active hand (right) and the other complementing. In this scenario, one would expect the kinetics to be related to stress points in the rhythmic progression. Thus, it would be interesting to have inferences on the individual differences between Ashwin and Prithvi on the vast difference of the same correlation values of 0.36 and 0.11, respectively. My final concern is about the effectiveness of calling the proposed dataset as an extension of Saraga. Like the authors think about having an independent identity of the instrumental dataset, calling this Saraga2.0 also warrants a thorough demonstration of the improvements expanding on Section 3.4, especially on the melody re-computation aspect.","The paper introduces an extended version of the Carnatic part of the Saraga dataset, presenting experimental results on music-motion relation analysis and music source separation.

Strengths
The proposed dataset offers a large amount of data with various ragas and talas. The addition of video recordings and automatic pose estimation results can be beneficial for research on the relationship between music and motion, which has recently gained popularity in Indian art music research. The paper also includes feedback from the research community on the previous version of the dataset, demonstrating exemplary progress in open science. The reproduction of Pearson et al.'s analysis using the new dataset shows the usefulness of automatically annotated pose information.

Weakness
- The fine-tuning result for the music source separation model, presented in section 4.2, does not strongly support the validation of this dataset's usefulness. This is not only because the fine-tuning degraded the model's performance on vocal artifacts, but also because similar experiments and results were already provided with Saraga 1.0 [17]. MSS can be fine-tuned for Carnatic music with Saraga 1.0, so it is not the exclusive usefulness of Saraga 2.0. The authors should explicitly show the advantage of using additional data from Saraga 2.0, such as by comparing a model trained only with Saraga 1.0 and a model trained with both Saraga 1.0 and 2.0.
- Including video is an interesting aspect of this dataset. However, the camera angle is not appropriate for capturing the posture of the violinist or mridangist. While the main interest in motion analysis might be the singer, the microphone and the stand obscure the singer's hand, as mentioned by the authors. In this sense, the dataset is not ideal for video analysis compared to other previous video recordings of vocal performances in Indian art music [16]. The authors should report the stability of the MMPose results, such as whether there was a sudden jump in hand location in the estimated gestures.
- It is not clear, but it seems that the paintings in the background are also detected as human postures. Additionally, it would be better for users if the pose estimation was provided separately for the singer and other players.

Minor comments
- In Table 1, it is not clear how the sum of Saraga 1.0 and 2.0 would look in terms of the total number of ragas or talas.
- I think the explanation on excluding instrumental Carnatic music can be shorten into one single sentence. It is worth mentioning that the current dataset does not cover instrumental Carnatic music, but I don't think the author has to justify why they are focusing on vocal-centered music with extensive paragraphs. The comparison with slakh sounds bit unnatural to me, as slakh used synthesizer. 
- It is not clear how many subjects participated in the listening test in Table 3. Also, the standard deviation or confidence interval has to be provided. 
- Saraga 1.0 also includes Hindustani music, but it is not clear how this will be handled in dataset access 
- There are duplicated sentences in line 224
- Line 353: ""for which the p-value is less than our significance level of 0.00001 are excluded"" – Should this be ""greater than the significance level""?
- Some words in the References, such as Carnatic and Turkish, need to be capitalized in the camera-ready version.","The manuscript presents extension to Saraga Carnatic dataset. Along with increasing coverage of various ragas, concerts, the new version introduces video recordings of the concerts for multimodal MIR research. The paper is well organised and well written, certain tasks are also benchmarked with the extended dataset.","- We have updated the naming convention of the dataset for clarity, and we have been consistent throughout the paper.
- We have improved the discussion on the video gathering to address the raised comments and questions by the Reviewers.
- We have included separation results of fine-tuned Spleeter using Saraga and Saraga Audiovisual (the new dataset) and improved the discussion on the relevance of these benchmarking experiments. We do not report fine-tuning experiments on the combination of Saraga and Saraga Audiovisual as our intention is to study the impact of each data collection process separately.
- We have included missing details in the perceptual test results.

Let us further comment on the questions about the video footage:
- The video gesture experiments are performed only on voice only excerpts called the alapana. These sections are not metered and also do not contain any rhythmic accompaniment.  The demo video is used only to show excerpts from the dataset and not correlated to the videos used for the gesture experiments. Figure 2 in the paper demonstrates the vocalist singing a composition in a rhythmic meter, but is illustrative of the video data in general and is not indicative of the alapana section on which the gesture experiments are perfomed. Figure 3 illustrates the vocalist singing an alapana.
- The video recordings are recorded from concert venues in the usual stage setting of the artists. In Carnatic music, the vocalist receives most prominence. Keeping in mind that the microphone placed directly in front of the vocalist causes visual occlusions of the mouth and the gestures made, several pose estimation models were tested before selecting the MMPose 2D-Top down model. This model manages to capture regions prone to occlusions like the singer’s mouth and the hands with a good level of accuracy. "

As an alternative, we propose a workflow and interface that allows users to quickly annotate jumps (by clicking on repeat signs), requiring a small amount of human supervision but yielding much higher quality alignments on average. Additionally, we refine audio and score feature representations to improve alignment quality by: (1) integrating measure detection into the score feature representation, and (2) using raw onset prediction probabilities from a music transcription model instead of piano roll. We propose an evaluation protocol for audio-to-score alignment that computes the distance between the estimated and ground truth alignment in units of measures.

The authors present a quick workflow for this task and demonstrate the effectiveness of the extra annotations (particularly the repeats) in their evaluation and provided videos.

Main Strengths:
- Clarity and Practicality: The paper is well-written, easy to understand, and presents a practical solution to the problem of aligning audio files with sheet music, especially when there are structural differences such as repeats or jumps.
- Effectiveness: Demonstrates a clear improvement over baseline systems when using annotated information on repeats and jumps, which highlights the practical application and potential benefits in real-world scenarios.
- Human-in-the-Loop Approach and Workflow Integration: Emphasises the value of human annotations in improving alignment accuracy, which is often overlooked in favour of fully automatic solutions. This approach is both quick and low in human effort. The workflow is cohesive and integrates well with existing state-of-the-art approaches, making it a robust engineering solution.
- Reproducibility: The promise to release the code upon acceptance ensures that the results can be reproduced and verified by others in the community.

Main Weaknesses:  
- Lack of Novelty: The approach lacks significant novelty from a research perspective. The idea of labelling repeats and using annotated jumps is not new, and the improvements over existing methods are not groundbreaking.
- Evaluation Scope: The evaluations, while showing improvements, lack depth in analysis. For instance, there is a need for a more detailed explanation of the significant accuracy jump attributed to feature representations.
- Dataset Limitations: The datasets used for evaluation are limited, particularly in the diversity of music types. The evaluation predominantly focuses on piano music, which may not fully represent the system’s capabilities.

Further Comments:
- The measure-aware alignment and evaluation make intuitive sense but could be perceived as arbitrary due to the variability in measure lengths.
- The proposed system’s baseline comparison should also consider using similar features to those of existing methods to ensure a fair evaluation.

Requested Improvements:  
- References: The references are inconsistently formatted and incomplete in some cases. Please resolve this for a potential final version. Also, some additional references of papers addressing jumps/repeats in the alignment context should be added (see the individual reviews).
- Features: Improvements in feature representation claims should be supported by evaluations on larger datasets like SMR, in addition to the relatively small M13 dataset. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of why the proposed feature representations supposedly lead to significant improvements.


Please also consider the more detailed comments by the individual reviewers.

Despite the lack of significant novelty, the paper presents a practical and effective solution to audio-to-sheet music alignment. Its clear writing, practical workflow, and demonstrated improvements in alignment accuracy make it a valuable contribution.","In this paper, the authors propose an audio-to-music-sheet synchronization system that combines several state-of-the-art approaches to detect notes and staff lines [16,17], measure positions [21], music transcription [3], and standard DTW [22]. On top of this engineering solution, the authors developed an interface to annotate jumps and repeats and feed the system with this information.

Evaluation has been performed at the measure level using the MeSA-13 and a subset from the SMR dataset. The proposed system is compared with the method in [17], which uses Hierarchical DTW to automatically account for the jumps and repeats. Results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system, especially when using the information from jumps and repeats. Other information, such as ground-truth measure and staff metadata, has been evaluated, showing a slight improvement.

The paper is well-structured and easy to read. The context of the paper is well presented, and several demonstrations of the technology are provided.

In my opinion, there is little novelty in the proposal from a research point of view, but I see the potential application from the technological side with several applications to the community and market (Musescore, page-turning systems, etc.). ","The motivation is clear and reasonable: to manually handle the jumps in alignment. The repetition labeling process brings significant improvement in accuracy with relatively low human effort. With the collected annotations, it is possible to automate the process with a model in the future.

I have a few minor comments:
1. I suggest moving Section 5 before the system description, as it does not depend on the alignment system (in fact, it’s the opposite).
2. In Table 1, it would be helpful to include results with only ground truth repeat annotations for comparison with the human labels.
3. The experimental settings for comparisons among different representations (L399-L402) are unclear. I guess this is related to different combinations of score features and audio features. The authors might want to clarify this.
4. The authors need to pay attention to the references: use a consistent format (proceeding names, conference names, etc.), fill in missing fields (authors, pages, years), and replace arXiv versions with proceedings versions where applicable.

Overall, the novelty and impact are not very high; therefore, I recommend a weak accept.","Short Paper Summary:
This paper proposes an audio-to-score alignment approach to align arbitrary music performances to sheet images. The approach extends and improves upon existing audio and score representations (bootleg score) for this task and further relies on minimal human intervention in the form of annotated jumps/repeats in the sheet image. This can usually be done quickly and is shown to significantly improve the alignment quality.
		
Note on Reproducibility:
The authors promise to release their code upon acceptance (and assumingly their annotation tool as well). Alongside the information on which pieces have been used for evaluation (given in the supplementary material) it should be possible to reproduce and verify the results.

Main Review:
While the basic components of the approach are not novel (bootleg-score inspired score representation, Onset & Frames to get a piano roll-like representation of the audio, DTW), I still think the practicality of the approach warrants an acceptance. The paper is clearly written and for the most part easy to follow along. That being said, some aspects of the paper could be improved.

In Section 3.1, it is not immediately clear to me how the shape of S_i (line 240) is derived. 88 for the pitch dimension is clear, but what’s the reasoning behind 48 and how would this impact the resolution of the score representation, e.g. with respect to extremely fast note runs?
I think the (index) variable i is used for two different things in lines 239/240/242. To make the difference more clear, I’d maybe suggest using another variable.
In the same section, when describing how the bootleg score is converted into a piano roll. Is C major always assumed as the default key? I might be reading the sentence (starting at line 253) wrong, or the end of the insertion mark is missing. 

In Section 3.2, the use of the onset predictions coming from the Onset & Frames model is introduced. It’s worth noting here that Shan and Tsai [16, 17] already used the onsets derived from the MIDI transcription of Onset & Frames for their bootleg score representation of the audio. I assume this is then similar to what is later on tested in Section 4.5 as onset predictions (with the difference of staying in a “piano roll space”), which has a similar performance as the onset probabilities. However, the evaluation for that seems to be done only on the relatively small M13 dataset. In order to really claim that this refined audio representation results in an improvement, I’d suggest also doing an evaluation on the larger SMR dataset.

Overall, I think the comparison and the claim around superiority “due to our refinements to feature representations” is not entirely fair and clearly shown in the experiment. Which is already acknowledged to some extent in the paper itself due to the proposed measure-wise evaluation.
If I’m not mistaken, nothing prevents the proposed approach to use similar features, i.e. same bootleg score representation as Shan and Tsai [16, 17]. Still performing measure segmentation, but basically stopping before the conversion to piano rolls described in 3.1. Such a model could be used as an additional baseline/vanilla version.
Alternatively, it might be possible to additionally extend the existing measure-aware evaluation to a system-level evaluation which would allow for a more direct and fairer comparison (although maybe not as useful wrt. to the overall alignment precision as the measure-aware version). 
In any case, I’m not doubting that the proposed approach is able to yield more precise results, but I think such a comparison could benefit the paper and better support the claims made. 

Minor Remarks:
- Line 493: “... that offers has an interactive …” -> “... that offers an interactive …”
- In the related work section, when writing “We diverge from them by considering a range of different types of raw score images and audio (such as ones with instrumentation beyond solo piano)” (lines 472 onwards). While this is shown in the supplementary material with some examples, the datasets used for evaluation only contain 1 or 2 samples that aren’t strictly piano music. Even though limited to piano music and also in the score following domain, another potentially related line of research to check out could be Henkel and Widmer ”Real-Time Music Following in Score Sheet Images via Multi-Resolution Prediction” as they also experiment with raw sheet image scans.
- I ticked ‘yes’ for “the paper adheres to ISMIR 2024 submission guidelines”, which is the case for the most part, but I want to make clear that the references are not well formatted. Please make sure to cite the proper conference version of papers instead of the arxiv ones, e.g. [1, 3, 12, 13, 15, 16, 37, 38] were published at ISMIR. Also, there are missing venues for [26, 29] and [19] shows a placeholder date.
","Updated Table 1 to reflect the final state of evaluation.
Decided against moving Section 5 before the system description to avoid confusion regarding some repeat annotations. For instance, the repeat annotations in MeSA-13 come from a different interface (not ours).
Upon being asked to include a setting with only ground truth repeat annotations in Table 1, we changed our wording in the caption to show that the human-labeled repeats are in fact also ground truth repeats.
Changed wording to clarify the experimental setting in Section 4.5.
Explained the shape of S_i in L240 in the same paragraph. 
Provided motivation for why we consider a half measure radius in our evaluation metric.
Fixed variables in L239/240/242.
Clarified that C major is always the default key.
Added clarification in Section 4.3 to emphasize that Shan et al. used the same model for piano transcription that we used, Onsets and Frames, however a different representation (MIDI transcription directly obtained from the model).
Added Table 2 to report results for the evaluation of different audio feature representations on both M13 and SMR.
Decided against reporting results from additional baselines since our focus in this paper is on showing that human-labeled repeats increase alignment accuracy considerably. Due to this, we did not evaluate the effect of minor algorithmic changes, but a more detailed analysis could be of interest in future work.
We also do not implement a system/line-level evaluation metric because even though that would allow us to evaluate our baseline’s performance in a different setting, our workflow aims for improvement on measure-level alignment, so we keep our focus on measure-level evaluation.
Included citations suggested by reviewers.
Included links to supplementary videos and our code for reproducibility as promised.
References are fixed to have consistent formatting and display all necessary information.

Our analyses concentrate on a compilation of field recordings from the Centre de Recherche en Ethnomusicologie (CREM) sound archive. To demonstrate the value of an interdisciplinary approach combining ethnomusicology and music information research to rhythmic analysis, we propose a case study on the bell patterns used in the musical practices of Candomblé, an Afro-Brazilian religion. After removing vocals from the recordings with a deep learning source separation technique, we further process the instrumental segments using non-negative matrix factorization and select the bell components. Then, we compute a tempo-agnostic rhythmic feature from the bell track and use it to cluster the data. Finally, we use synthesized patterns from the musicological literature about Candomblé as references to propagate labels to the rhythmic clusters in our data. This semi-supervised approach to pattern analysis precludes the need for downbeat and cycle annotations, making it particularly suited for extensive archive investigations. Lastly, by comparing bell patterns in Candomblé and a West African music tradition, we lay the foundation for our future cross-cultural research and observe the potential application of this methodology to other time-line-based music.",Lucas S Maia,Lucas S Maia (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro)*; Richa Namballa (New York University); Martín Rocamora (Universidad de la República); Magdalena Fuentes (New York University); Carlos Guedes (NYU Abu Dhabi),"Maia, Lucas S*; Namballa, Richa; Rocamora, Martín; Fuentes, Magdalena; Guedes, Carlos",Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR -> computational ethnomusicology,Applications -> music heritage and sustainability; Creativity -> humanistic discussions; MIR tasks -> pattern matching and detection; Musical features and properties -> representations of music; Philosophical and ethical discussions -> legal and societal aspects of MIR,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FEBBNQF6eV4wxgOTzXmIcyEYtQ9PR0UQ/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N-NXiV5hUmDU4GbbMMXyN8f7T89Tw8Cv/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_OYp2YWSaG6tqPTJAoKcLsZSz6QX_VxM/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/158UbPnkqeYdglOF6iEf3aoz93GZgaJMq/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d1BQIVSEZL9v5YxSiOLrksEB_RiP-WO-/view?usp=sharing,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07VCSXQQTS,p7-17-investigating-time-line,,,,,

367,3,6,6,San Francisco,FALSE,"A New Dataset, Notation Software, and Representation for Computational Schenkerian Analysis","Schenkerian Analysis (SchA) is a uniquely expressive method of music analysis, combining elements of melody, harmony, counterpoint, and form to describe the hierarchical structure supporting a work of music. However, despite its powerful analytical utility and potential to improve music understanding and generation, SchA has rarely been utilized by the computer music community. This is in large part due to the paucity of available high-quality data in a computer-readable format. With a larger corpus of Schenkerian data, it may be possible to infuse machine learning models with a deeper understanding of musical structure, leading to more ""human"" results.  To encourage further research in Schenkerian analysis and its potential benefits for music informatics and generation, this paper presents three main contributions: 1) a new and growing dataset of SchAs, the largest in human- and computer-readable formats to date (>140 excerpts), 2) a novel software for visualization and collection of SchA data, and 3) a novel, flexible representation of SchA as a heterogeneous-edge graph data structure.",Stephen Hahn,Stephen Hahn (Duke)*; Weihan Xu (duke); Zirui Yin (Duke University); Rico Zhu (Duke University); Simon Mak (Duke University); Yue Jiang (Duke University); Cynthia Rudin (Duke),"Hahn, Stephen*; Xu, Weihan; Yin, Zirui; Zhu, Rico; Mak, Simon; Jiang, Yue; Rudin, Cynthia","Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility -> novel datasets and use cases","Human-centered MIR -> music interfaces and services; MIR fundamentals and methodology -> symbolic music processing; Musical features and properties -> structure, segmentation, and form",,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/19RtCI-wJZy7RKj7oEz7gD-94TMkdRPIb/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mx1xF6y1fZBStu2DGS_5gp6RSQ9qIIUX/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ME_Waz-jgKrb5fOavvJYK97jwteeVLYf/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/18VRICoSc5LG6v_g1NaXDOciRyR9IBUa0/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vM09esMw8Abv2UXOTDjog0wHD81FdoR-/view?usp=drive_link,https://ismir2024.slack.com/archives/C07VCR7PY6L,p6-06-a-new-dataset,"All the reviewers appreciated that the paper is well-written and clear, with an appropriate bibliography, and is scientifically sound, making it a valuable contribution to the community.

Some remarks were done about the availability of the data (all reviewers) and some suggestions of improvement were made, to explain more in details the dataset, its metadata and its links to other datasets (R2, R3, MR), to provide more details on the notation software (R2) and to improve and clarify the figures (all reviewers).

Please take into account those comments for the final version of your paper.","I greatly congratulate the authors on their work! I am pleased to see initiatives that move from black-box models to generative tasks and focus on more interpretable models, especially applied to complex and often subjective tasks like Schenkerian analysis. The brief explanation of Schenkerian analysis in Section 1.1 helps the reader who is not an expert in the subject to understand minimally what the process entails. Furthermore, throughout the work, the authors take care to discuss musically their points, always using the same example.

I have a few minor suggestions for the authors:

* In lines 219 to 221, the authors mention that the dataset consists of pieces from the common practice period, Gentle Giant, and others. I must admit, I am very curious to know what falls in between! For example, are there rock pieces with simpler melodies/harmonies, like Elvis Presley, Beatles? As a big fan of Gentle Giant, I'm aware that they make extensive use of ideas from common practice in their pieces (e.g., Knots, In Reflection), but with a significant harmonic and melodic modernization. To what extent can the usual Schenkerian analysis capture these nuances? I ask this because I am aware of a work of Schenkerian analysis applied to Brazilian Popular Music (https://www.scielo.br/j/pm/a/Q93rFfZWy49cm9xjb3mwCQt/?format=pdf in Portuguese -- I hope the authors can read it, as I do not know their nationality), and some adaptations are necessary to capture specific nuances of the aesthetic.

* Will the software be made public? Open-source? Freeware? I understand that the software may still be unsuitable for widespread use in its current state, but it is important to mention the future of the software for readers who might want to use it.

* I know that positioning figures in LaTeX is difficult, but Figs. 2 and 3 appear after Fig. 4. It would be good to fix that.

* Using a single color in the bar graph of Fig. 3 would make it easier to read.

* In Fig. 4, having the x-axis ticks every 1 would be helpful.

* The proposal could also be used to assist in teaching Schenkerian analysis! Perhaps this is something important to mention.

I conclude my comments once again by congratulating the authors for tackling a complex problem!","The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough bibliography. The context is well set on Schenkerian analysis. The encoding formats and graphical representations (fig.2b) are convincing. It has three main contributions. Whereas the graph structure is well detailed in Section 3 (and supported by Figure 5, which is enlightening), I would expect more details for both the dataset and especially the notation software.

The dataset:
- Its process of creation can be slightly more detailed. Regardless of the name of the analysts (who could even remain anonymous after the publication), it can be useful to know more about their respective experience (experts in music composition, musicology, Schenkerian analysis? ; level/years of practice?). Any annotation guidelines specific to the format or tool used, any potential source of disagreement (potentially reduced by a reviewing process between analysts for example)?
- Indicate where the dataset would be available, even in a submission, with an fake/anonymous URL. As the dataset is meant to grow, it also becomes important to number the versions/releases of your dataset to make experiments reproducible (for possible ""We trained our model on 'SchA' Dataset V1.1.7 (180 samples)"") and keep track of the evolution.
  - In that sense, I recommend saving JSON format (which is already a sensible choice for machine- and human-readability) in unfolded versions to make them more human-readable, and easier to track changes in version control systems. (In supplementary material, provided samples are one-liners)
- Stick with the current number of analyses: 145 -- even if future versions will include more of them.
- The analyses of some statistics of the dataset is appreciated. Some comments in l.243-268 are important to understand the figures/table, and should be added in their captions, to make the figures more readable, more autonomous.
- Provide more information about the metadata. If not in the paper, at least in a summary file in the dataset location.

The notation software:
- In current state, the dataset and graph representation are the main contributions of the paper; and they are valuable. The software appears primarily as a tool that the authors (or analysts) used to produce and read the data. But it is not well documented, although it appears in the title.
- Among other questions:
  - What technology or language is used?
  - Is it a script to run, an executable, a web application? This can be critical for accessibility, if the goal is to facilitate SchA annotation at scale.
  - How the user interact with the system? If it displays the graphical representation of an JSON annotation, it is already interesting, but it needs to be explicitly mentioned. Can users interact the graphical representation, with JSON or both? What is an example of ""simple commands"" (l.275)?
- l.279: In this context, the formulation ""We are currently working on..."" leaves a feeling of unfinished work. Nevertheless, it is completely okay to indicate what the features of current version are, and then evoke separately other features to be included in a future release. (minor issue)

I believe the contributions of this paper are valuable, but it has to be made clear whether:
- 1. the software can be used as it is by the community, and it is a major : in this case, it needs more details to be understood *how*.
- or 2. it is a tool to facilitate building the dataset: in this case, it is a program which is part of the creation process of the dataset; it is not the main topic of this paper, and can be removed from the title. This framework is still precious and the code usable by the community.

Minor comments on the form:
- If possible, improve the position of figures so that more references are on the same pages as their figure, especially Figures 2, 3 and 4. Try splitting 3a and 3b in two separate figures (even if they stay at the same position). As mentioned before, captions can be more explicit.
- Some use of quotes sometimes put unnecessary distance. l.126 ""fractal"" is justified if it comes from the reference (same for ""goodness metric"" l.153), but ""big data"" l.23, ""atonal"" l.74, ""human"" l.13 (?), ""ground truth"" l.198 are better established concepts that can be in plain text, or in italic if it really needs to stand out.
- 1.1 and 1.2 can form an autonomous Section 2 ""History of computational SchA / State of the art / Related work"", separate from the introduction, which sounds concluding after the outlines in l.101-105.","This paper introduces an extension to a previously not so explored dataset, incorporating Schenkerian analyses of classical music. The newly added data focuses mostly on monophonic short fugal themes from the Baroque era. In my view, any open-source dataset constitutes a valuable asset for the community. Moreover, the availability of expert musicological annotations for Schenkerian analysis is both rare and precious.

Here are some comments and suggestions for the authors:

1. Availability of Data: It is mentioned in the paper that the dataset contains 145 new excerpts, but there is no clear indication in the paper regarding whether this data will be made publicly available. If it is intended to be public, I recommend including an anonymized link in the paper or explicitly stating its public availability in the final version.

2. Clarity on Dataset Composition: From the examples provided and the supplementary material, it is implied that most of the data consists of short monophonic melodies. It would be beneficial for clarity if the authors explicitly state this information in the text if this is the case, otherwise I would highly suggest to include a more complete polyphonic example since space allows it. The excerpts depicted in Figure 4 may not fully convey this aspect, hence clarifying it within the text would be a plus for clarity.

3. Clarification on Clustering Example: The clustering example presented in Figure 5 prompts the question of whether only pairs of note contractions are allowed for each level transition. In Schenkerian analysis, multiple notes can be reduced from the Foreground to the Middleground in a single step. While this doesn't pose a significant issue, it may be prudent to mention this fact within the paper to enhance clarity.

4. Integration with Pre-existing Datasets: A key aspect of any new dataset paper is linking the new data with existing datasets. This is particularly crucial for smaller-scale musicological datasets. Given that the dataset in this paper includes fugal themes from the Well-Tempered Clavier (WTC), it could complement the ALGOMUS Bach fugues dataset effectively. I strongly recommend that the authors associate any related fugal themes from their dataset with existing datasets in the future (and add it as future work), as multi-level analyses are especially valuable in sparse musicological datasets.","We added information about the analysts, availability of the dataset and notation software, and technology used for the notation software. Additionally, several small clarity edits were made, such as added plot ticks, rearranging of figure location, etc."

This study examines the effectiveness of electroencephalogram (EEG) in predicting the subjective experiences while listening to music, including arousal, valence, familiarity, and preference. We collected EEG data alongside subjective ratings of arousal, valence, familiarity, and preference from both fans (N=20) and non-fans (N=34) of the K-pop idol group, NCT127 to investigate response variability to the same NCT127 music. Our analysis focused on determining whether the inclusion of EEG alongside audio features could enhance the predictive power of linear mixed-effects models for these subjective ratings. Specifically, we employed stimulus-response correlation (SRC), a recent approach in neuroscience correlating stimulus features with EEG responses to the ecologically valid stimuli. The results showed that familiarity and preference was significantly higher in the fan group. Furthermore, the inclusion of SRC significantly enhanced the prediction of familiarity compared to models based solely on audio features. However, the impact of SRC on predictions of arousal and valence exhibited variation depending on the correlated audio features, with certain SRCs improving predictions while others diminished them. For preference, only a few SRCs negatively affected model performance.

In this framework, all events (notes or pedals) are represented as closed time intervals tied to specific event types. The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. This paper introduces a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only structured non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision.

396,3,6,17,San Francisco,FALSE,Music Discovery Dialogue Generation Using Human Intent Analysis and Large Language Model,"A conversational music retrieval system can help users discover music that matches their preferences through dialogue. To achieve this, a conversational music retrieval system should seamlessly engage in multi-turn conversation by 1) understanding user queries and 2) responding with natural language and retrieved music. A straightforward solution would be a data-driven approach utilizing such conversation logs. However, few datasets are available for the research and are limited in terms of volume and quality. In this paper, we present a data generation framework for rich music discovery dialogue using a large language model (LLM) and user intents, system actions, and musical attributes. This is done by i) dialogue intent analysis using grounded theory, ii) generating attribute sequences via cascading database filtering, and iii) generating utterances using large language models.

405,1,1,20,San Francisco,FALSE,Using Pairwise Link Prediction and Graph Attention Networks for Music Structure Analysis,"The task of music structure analysis has been mostly addressed as a sequential problem, by relying on the internal homogeneity of musical sections or their repetitions. In this work, we instead regard it as a pairwise link prediction task. If for any pair of time instants in a track, one can successfully predict whether they belong to the same structural entity or not, then the underlying structure can be easily recovered. Building upon this assumption, we propose a method that first learns to classify pairwise links between time frames as belonging to the same section (or segment) or not. The resulting link features, along with node-specific information, are combined through a graph attention network. The latter is regularized with a graph partitioning training objective and outputs boundary locations between musical segments and section labels.

All had constructive criticisms, on different aspects of the paper. The concerns included:

- lack of context about the kind of music assumed to be the target of the method;
- lack of certainty that the evaluation is fair;
- lack of motivation for using graph neural networks, instead of a simpler Transformer approach;
- lack of depth in the ablation study.

In the discussion between reviewers, we all agreed that these were valid concerns, but we disagreed about their severity. We hope that the authors can take all of the suggestions on board as they revise this paper.","The paper proposes a music structure analysis technique based on pairwise link prediction using graph neural networks. A general criticism I have of this work is a problem that is noticeable in various studies in this field: before starting a proposal for music structure analysis, there is never a preliminary musical discussion. Specifically:

1- Repertoire as a corpus: What is the repertoire to be used as corpus? This only appears in the discussion of the experiment.
2 - Notion of musical structure: Given a specific corpus, what is the notion of musical structure and what should be examined in the corpus to highlight this structure?
3 - Detection difficulties and tools: Given a specific corpus, what are the difficulties in detecting structure and what tools have already been used to address this challenge?

For example, the audio representation used in this case is a MEL spectrogram representation with slices centred around each detected beat position. This means that there is an extremely limited universe of corpora that this algorithm can analyse, i.e. music where the beat is a crucial element.

Therefore, I strongly suggest a better contextualisation of the tasks and the corpus for which this tool is intended, trying not to ignore the problems of musical nature involved in tasks of musical structure analysis. ","The paper contains a novel approach, is mostly well-written and has high-quality Figures (and very estetically pleasant). However, as I wrote above, there are two points which I find very problematic. I believe that correcting them could make for a very strong paper. In the following there is a list of other minor problems and suggestions.

11: “as whether connecting elements from the same segment or section”. Something sounds wrong in this sentence. I would suggest changing it to “as belonging to the same section (or segment) or not”.
15: “boundary locations between musical segments and section labels”. This is confusing for me. Is the music consisting of a an alternance of musical segments and section labels?
The terms “segment” and “section” and “structural entity” are used in the abstract without specifying if they are synonyms, or if they are not, in what they differ. This is a bit confusing for a reader that is approaching the field. I suggest using only one term if possible, or explaining the differences between the terms.
29: typo. “These” refer to a plural but “corpus” is singular. The authors can use either “corpuses” or “corpora”.
36: what is an “event”? A sound from an instrument? And is the term “musical observation” used in the next sentence synonym of “event”? The part up to line 40 is not very clear to me.
38: what is the “multi-level dependency”. With the term “dependency” I imagine a link between two things. How can it be multi-level? The paper [1] speaks about “multiple timescales, but not about dependencies. This term is used further in the Section, but I can’t understand what it means.
Section 1.1 or 1.2: the gap sentence is missing. What is the problem in the current approaches that is solved in this paper? This is the core point of scientific papers, and without it, this paper loses a lot of its interest. The sole goal of “doing something different” is not so appealing to a reader. I invite the authors to find something that their model can do better than others and to write it very clearly.
42: how is the paper [7] relevant to to the point of the paragraph? This is a graph neural network paper that doesn’t deal with music. Moreover, is [16] also part of this group of papers that uses self-attention? If yes, it should be added.
85: a new term “audio observation” without a very intuitive meaning is introduced. Do the authors mean “audio frame”? In this case, I would use this more common term.

I’m extremely confused about the use of the GNN. A GNN is useful when there is a predefined graph structure to leverage. When connecting everything to everything (like 

180-185: How can an MLP limit the oversmoothing problem? In my understanding, if the representations are too similar, there is nothing an MLP (which receives such representations as input) can do. A citation could help here if this is true. 

The claim that the system is lightweight and has low parameters should be supported by numbers. But the number of parameters, or the training time for other papers is missing.","— RESUME —
This paper presents a novel structure analysis method that outputs each section's boundaries and labels. The main idea is to exploit the pairwise links between audio segments, i.e., predict whether a pair of audio segments below has the same structure. The authors suggest aggregating all these connections into a graph, which is then used to address the tasks in supervised learning.SSM

— SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION —
The main contribution lies in applying graph neural networks for modelling music structures, a novel approach that opens up new avenues for music analysis and machine learning. 

— METHODOLOGY —

The authors propose a three-step method:
1- Feature extraction: this step creates the best feature for capturing the pairwise links and builds a self-similarity matrix (SSM) as an adjacency matrix. This process consists of:

	a) Audio frame selection: it reduces the length of the audio sequence by selecting frames around the beats. Beats are obtained via a pertaining beat detection method. It's not explicitly said, but I guess this is due to memory limitations. Otherwise, why is there interest in doing that? And what's the reason that backs up the hypnosis that beat frames are more informative than off-beat frames regarding structure detections?  
	b) Frame encoder transforms the audio signal into a feature vector that captures structure information. This block is based on previous works and applies self-supervised independently of the following blocks. It outputs a feature vector X. 
	c) Feature refinement: This step involves making each frame exchange information between all the other frames in the track. The final features are called X'. This step is quite exciting and introduces the first graph network block. It is based on the hypothesis that the features obtained from the frame encoder are independent and, thus, won't capture proper pairwise links nor share any information between them. While this sounds intuitive, there are no experiments to back up this hypothesis since no ablation study has been conducted to test the importance of this feature refinement block.

On top of these feature vectors, the author gets an adjacency matrix that resumes all the pairwise connections between audio frames. They called this matrix A'.

2- A method to find and classify each link between features. The authors define three types of pairwise links: same segment, same section, and different section. I don't see an interest in differentiating between segments that belong to the same segment from those that belong to the same section since the former is a subcategory of the latter. Why is this distinction needed?  
	a) The authors propose a CNN block to process the SSM to find regular homogeny areas repeated over time. The idea is that these areas correspond to the final structure of the song. This step aims to categorise (and impose) pairwise links between the frames w.r.t. the overall song structure. The output has the same dimension as A', called E'.
	b) They add positional embedding to distinguish between the same segment/section category. I need clarification about why this is required and its utility is never shown in the ablation studies. 

Here, we have the first loss, which classifies each E' component into one of the three categories they define. It is not detailed how the cross-entropy loss is applied in this context. I'm assuming the loss is computed per row (?), where the index row serves as a reference point, and the loss evaluates the rest of the components within the row. 

3- The final block combines the acoustics information X' with the matrix E', a refined version highlighting mutual information. This block consists of a graph attention mechanism. The output is a final feature vector X'' used for the final boundary and label classifications. They add a final regularisation term to encourage orthogonality between label classes. The author fixed the number of possible classes to K for the whole dataset. 

One missing explanation is that one song is equal to a batch to be sure that all the selected points after the beat track step below the same song to avoid refining them with features from other songs. How does this affect the training? i.e. since all the points in a batch share the same musical traits, isn't that problematic when propagating the gradient? 

- RESULTS AND DISCUSSION - 

The authors validate their model on two datasets, RWC-Pop and Harmonix. However, they don't use the Jazz Structure Dataset (JSD) or Salami, which are commonly used to benchmark the music structure task.
It is good to see a k-fold cross-validation study and a cross-dataset evaluation. This helps assess the model's actual performance while providing proper metric ranges.

I appreciate the ablation study, but it misses some important experiments. I miss some further studies of each step independently:

1- On the feature extraction step to address the quality of the SSM matrices obtained. This could have been done by comparing them directly with the ground-truth annotation. Moreover, the benefit of the Feature refinement block has yet to be tested. How much does it contribute to the overall performance? Is it better than computing the adjacency matrix on top of the feature produced by the feature encoder? The fact that the results drop so much when removing the Link Feature block may indicate that the obtained SSM A' is not informative enough for detecting structures. 

2— Link Feature block: Since this block can process any SSM, how powerful is it? I would have been curious to see the performance when training this block on top of another SSM. For instance, a good baseline could have been to compare the performance obtained with SSM obtained from well-known musical feature descriptors such as chroma, MFCC, or tempo grams vs. their proposed feature extraction method. 

3- Combining link features with acoustics features. Since this block consists of an attention mechanism that combines X' and E', how does it work for the ablation experiment where the link feature (which produces E') is removed? Similarly, how informative is the E' matrix w.r.t the final tasks? Why do we need a combination of both?

A good point is the small size of the model—only 330K. To better understand its significance, it would have been more informative to include the number of parameters of the compared model.  

The significant insight here is that their model can effectively generate a feature vector X'' that captures structural section information. This is an interesting observation because their feature vector is correlated with meaningful musical sections. I'm curious about how widely applicable this insight is. The authors have set the number of sections to K = 7 (they don't mention their taxonomy), which may not be representative of all possible music sections but is likely sufficient to cover most popular Western music.

— FINAL COMMENT —
The utilization of graph neural networks is quite fascinating. The pairwise relationship hypothesis is intriguing, and the outcomes emphasize the grouping capabilities of their final feature vector. However, they introduce a three-step model that is primarily tested as a whole, making it difficult to evaluate the contribution of each component as well as their reusability out of their full formalisation. Furthermore, many of the design choices made need to be justified or properly evaluated. ","We thank the reviewers and meta-reviewer for their valuable insight and feedback on our work. We address here the main concerns that emerged through the reviewing process:

- Lack of context about the kind of music assumed to be the target of the method: We added a mention in our contribution that this work addresses the analysis of structure mostly for western popular music. This decision was based upon the availability of annotated data and the label taxonomy employed in previous work, so as to ease comparison with our method. In fact, the extension of the approach to different types of musical structures is a research direction we aim to undertake, and mention it in the conclusion of the paper. 

- Lack of certainty that the evaluation is fair: Our evaluation process has tried to closely follow that of previous work, where baseline systems are evaluated both in cross-validation and cross-dataset settings. However, comparisons should still be cautiously apprehended as some baselines used additional training data or augmentation strategies. Concerning the reported baseline results, we added a row in Table 1 to include the different configurations of one of them (SpecTNT). 

- Lack of motivation for using graph neural networks, instead of a simpler Transformer approach: The graph neural network framework is actually a generalization of the transformer approach when applied on a fully-connected graph. We added however a few words as to why graph neural networks are employed in our method (mainly to include link features into the attention coefficients calculation and the frame feature update).

- Lack of depth in the ablation study: Our initial ablation study aimed at focusing on the most peculiar aspects of our method. However, we ran additional ablation experiments by also discarding the remaining steps of our method and updated Figure 4 accordingly. "
