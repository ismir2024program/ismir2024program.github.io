Their input has been guiding our state-of-the-art generative music experiments, and helping us ensure that our new generative AI tools responsibly open the doors of music creation to everyone.\n\nRecently, in partnership with [Google Labs](https://blog.google/technology/ai/jacob-collier-labs-sessions), we released a reimagined experience for [MusicFX DJ](http://labs.google/musicfx) that makes it easier for anyone to generate music, interactively, in real time.\n\nWe've also recently released updates to our music AI toolkit, called [Music AI Sandbox](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-generative-ai-veo-imagen-3/), and highlighted our latest AI music technologies in [YouTube\u2019s Dream Track](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/transforming-the-future-of-music-creation/), a suite of experiments that creators can use to generate high-quality instrumentals for their Shorts and videos.\n\nTo learn more about our recent efforts in music AI, [please see this blog post](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/new-generative-ai-tools-open-the-doors-of-music-creation/), and look out for future job openings at [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/careers) and [Google Research](https://research.google/careers/).",
