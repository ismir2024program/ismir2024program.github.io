    "description": "Language serves as an efficient interface for communication between humans as well as between humans and machines. Through the integration of recent advancements in deep learning-based language models, the understanding, search, and creation of music is becoming capable of catering to user preferences with better diversity and control. This tutorial will start with an introduction to how machines understand natural language, alongside recent advancements in language models, and their application across various domains. We will then shift our focus to MIR tasks that incorporate these cutting-edge language models. The core of our discussion will be segmented into three pivotal themes: music understanding through audio annotation and beyond, text-to-music retrieval for music search, and text-to-music generation to craft novel sounds. In parallel, we aim to establish a solid foundation for the emergent field of music-language research, and encourage participation from new researchers by offering comprehensive access to 1) relevant datasets, 2) evaluation methods, and 3) coding best practices.",

    "description": "In one form or another, most MIR research depends on the judgment of humans. Humans provide our ground-truth data, whether through explicit annotation or through observable behavior (e.g., listening histories); Humans also evaluate our results, whether in academic research reports or in the commercial marketplace. Will users like it? Will customers buy it? Does it sound good? These are all critical questions for MIR researchers which can only be answered by asking people. Unfortunately, measuring and interpreting the judgments and experiences of humans in a rigorous manner is difficult. Human responses can be fickle, changeable, and inconsistent\u2014they are, by definition, subjective. There are many factors that influence human responses, some of which can be controlled or accounted for in experimental design, and others which must be tolerated but ameliorated through statistical analysis. Fortunately, researchers in the field of behavioral psychology have amassed extensive expertise and institutional knowledge related to the practice and pedagogy of human-subject research, but MIR researchers receive little exposure to research methods involving human subjects. This tutorial, led by MIR researchers with training (and publications) in psychological research, aims to share these insights with the ISMIR community. The tutorial will introduce key concepts, terminology, and concerns in carrying out human-subject research, all in the context of MIR. Through the discussion of real and hypothetical human research, we will explore the nuances of experiment and survey design, stimuli creation, sampling, psychometric modeling, and statistical analysis. We will review common pitfalls and confounds in human research, and present guidelines for best practices in the field. We will also cover fundamental ethical and legal requirements of human research. Any and all ISMIR members are welcome and encouraged to attend: it is never too early, or too late, in one\u2019s research career to learn (or practice) these essential skills.",

    "description": "Audio-based MIR (MIR based on the processing of audio signals) covers a broad range of tasks, including analysis (pitch, chord, beats, tagging), similarity/cover identification, and processing/generation of samples or music fragments. A wide range of techniques can be employed for solving each of these tasks, spanning from conventional signal processing and machine learning algorithms to the whole zoo of deep learning techniques.\n \n\n This tutorial aims to review the various elements of this deep learning zoo commonly applied in Audio-based MIR tasks. We review typical audio front-ends (such as waveform, Log-Mel-Spectrogram, HCQT, SincNet, LEAF, quantization using VQ-VAE, RVQ), as well as projections (including 1D-Conv, 2D-Conv, Dilated-Conv, TCN, WaveNet, RNN, Transformer, Conformer, U-Net, VAE), and examine the various training paradigms (such as supervised, self-supervised, metric-learning, adversarial, encoder-decoder, diffusion). Rather than providing an exhaustive list of all of these elements, we illustrate their use within a subset of (commonly studied) Audio-based MIR tasks such as multi-pitch/chord-estimation, cover-detection, auto-tagging, source separation, music-translation or music generation. This subset of Audio-based MIR tasks is designed to encompass a wide range of deep learning elements. For each tack we address a) the goal of the tasks, b) how it is evaluated, c) provide some popular datasets to train a system, and d) explain (using slides and pytorch code) how we can solve it using deep learning.\n \n\n The objective is to provide a 101 lecture (introductory lecture) on deep learning techniques for Audio-based MIR. It does not aim at being exhaustive in terms of Audio-based MIR tasks nor on deep learning techniques but to provide an overview for newcomers to Audio-Based MIR on how to solve the most common tasks using deep learning. It will provide a portfolio of codes (Colab notebooks and Jupyter book) to help newcomers achieve the various Audio-based MIR Tasks.",

    "description": "Singing, a universal human practice, intertwines with lyrics to form a core part of profound musical experiences, conveying emotions, narratives, and real-world connections. This tutorial explores the commonly used techniques and practices in lyrics and singing voice processing, which are vital in numerous music information retrieval tasks and applications.\n\nDespite the importance of song lyrics in MIR and the industry, high-quality paired audio & transcript annotations are often scarce. In the first part of this tutorial, we'll delve into automatic lyrics transcription and alignment techniques, which significantly reduce the annotation cost and enable more performant solutions. Our tutorial provides insights into the current state-of-the-art methods for transcription and alignment, highlighting their capabilities and limitations while fostering further research into these systems.\n\nMoreover, we present \"lyrics information processing\", which encompasses lyrics generation and leveraging lyrics to discern musically relevant aspects such as emotions, themes, and song structure. Understanding the rich information embedded in lyrics opens avenues for enhancing audio-based tasks by incorporating lyrics as supplementary input. \n\nFinally, we discuss singing voice conversion as one such task, which involves the conversion of acoustic features embedded in a vocal signal, often relating to timbre and pitch. We explore how lyric-based features can facilitate a model's inherent disentanglement between acoustic and linguistic content, which leads to more convincing conversions. This section closes with a brief discussion on the ethical concerns and responsibilities that should be considered in this area.\n\nThis tutorial caters especially to new researchers with an interest in lyrics and singing voice modeling, or those involved in improving lyrics alignment and transcription methodologies. It can also inspire researchers to leverage lyrics for improved performance on tasks like singing voice separation, music and singing voice generation, and cover song and emotion recognition.\n",

    "organiser_bio": "Valerie Joseph earned a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Her doctoral research investigated the enduring legacies of British colonialism and African heritage memory among the members of the African Diaspora in Carriacou, Grenada. Specifically, she mapped how the game songs and dance play of Carriacouan Black girls as well as their words, beliefs, and attitudes reflected both the detrimental internalization of colonial ideology and the restorative nature of African retentions.\n\nPrior to her fieldwork in Carriacou, Dr. Joseph lived and worked in Botswana for seven years starting as a Peace Corps Volunteer science teacher in a junior secondary school, then as a training coordinator at the Cheshire Foundation's Mogoditshane Rehabilitation Center. She closed out her years in the country by working as co-director of the School for International Training's college semester abroad program. During her time in Botswana, Dr. Joseph sharpened her interest in cross-cultural conflicts, including those that seemed to be intractable, though traceable, in part, to cultural mores as well as historical and social patterns embedded in racial or ethnic bias and discrimination.\n\nDr. Joseph has a Masters in Movement Therapy with a concentration in counseling psychology and a Masters in Social Justice Education. Her supplemental training, work and experience in several fields includes gymnastics coaching, dance performance, diversity training, Authentic Movement (a contemplative dance form), mediation, teaching and management in higher education.\n\nDr. Joseph is an educator-interventionist working at Smith College as the Mentoring Administrative Director for AEMES (Achieving Excellence in Math Engineering and Science). In that role, she manages programs to support the most marginalized students who are pursuing STEM. She also teaches college success seminars within the AEMES Scholars Program.\n\nDr. Joseph is co-founder of the Smith Roundtable Group. Started in 2020, the SRG is a small contingent of staff, faculty, and students dedicated to creating opportunities for information sharing and conversation about important current events. Past Roundtable offerings included: \u201cDaring to be Hopeful: A Critical Response to the White Supremacist Storming of Our Capitol\u201d and \u201cWhy is the Power of Young People so Threatening to the Status Quo?\u201d The most recent Roundtable event took place in September of this year: \"'Calling In' for Democracy and Human Rights: A Consideration of Project 2025.\"\n\nIn and outside of Smith, Dr. Joseph convenes a unique form of public discourse that she originated. Grounded Knowledge Panels\u00ae are public conversations by small groups of people who have realistic, authentic and personal experience and understanding of a particular topic or question. Emerging from core Black culture, Grounded Knowledge Panels are a synthesis of Dr. Joseph's study and work in various fields including anthropology, Authentic Movement, education and mediation. As panelists converse among themselves, audience members are invited as \u201cwitnesses\u201d to observe the discussion. Both groups \\- panelists and witnesses \u2013 bring a distinctive power, depth and responsibility to the experience of speaking and listening.\n\nDr. Joseph is a five time recipient of the Smith College Spotlight Award, an honor presented to staff members, chosen by peers, in appreciation of exceptional service. She is a 2020 recipient of the Elizabeth B. Wyant Gavel Award awarded by students to staff members who have performed outstanding work in the Smith community.\n\nDr. Joseph's first children's book, [This is What Maisie Believes](https://www.groundedspaceconsulting.com/books), is published by 619 Wreath Publishing.",

    "description": "Join us for short presentations and informal conversations with invited researchers from the MIR community\\!\n\n**Amanda Krause**\n\nTitle: Can we categorise younger adult listeners?\n\nAbstract: The evolution of digital listening technologies continues to impact the way we think about music consumption and music listening practices. Krause and North\u2019s (2016) findings suggest that, in addition to demographic characteristics, psychological constructs should be considered when investigating listening practices and technology use. The present study uses latent profile analysis (LPA), which is a statistical technique that focuses on identifying latent subgroups within a population based on a set of variables. With this study, LPA affords us the opportunity to attempt to categorise types of music listeners. To explore this possibility, we draw on data collected from a sample of 584 younger adults residing in Australia (Mage \\= 19.62; 74.10% female). Participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire that included demographics, the musicianship module of the MUSEBAQ (Chin, et al., 2018), the Music Engagement Test (MET; Greenberg & Rentfrow, 2015), Langford\u2019s (2003) Big Five proxy personality scale, Krause and Hargreave\u2019s (2013) Music Self-Images Questionnaire, and Krause and Brown\u2019s (2021) format use measure. With analyses underway, preliminary indications suggest that format use and MET scores may differentiate listener typologies. Study findings further our theoretical understanding of how individuals consume music in everyday life.\n\nHer passion for researching the social and applied psychology of music has led her to give guest lectures and public talks and serve as President of the Australian Music & Psychology Society (AMPS). She is the author of numerous peer-reviewed academic publications and has spoken on her research to academics and industry leaders at conferences around the world. Her research has made significant contributions to understanding how listening technologies influence people\u2019s experiences and how musical engagement impacts well-being. Dr Krause\u2019s current programs of research concern how everyday music and radio experiences influence people\u2019s well-being.\n\n**Sebastian Stober**\n\nTitle: \"Generative AI Training and Copyright Law\u201d\n\nAbstract: Training generative AI models requires extensive amounts of data. A common practice is to collect such data through web scraping. In the USA, AI developers rely on \"fair use\" and in Europe, the prevailing view is that the exception for \"Text and Data Mining\" (TDM) applies. In a recent interdisciplinary tandem-study with a legal expert, I have argued in detail that this is actually not the case because generative AI training fundamentally differs from TDM. In this talk, I will share our main findings and the implications for both public and corporate research on generative models. I will further discuss how the phenomenon of training data memorization leads to copyright issues independently from the \"fair use\" and TDM exceptions. Finally, I would like to outline how the ISMIR could contribute to the ongoing discussion about fair practices with respect to generative AI that satisfy all stakeholders.",

    "description": "Join us for short presentations and informal conversations with invited researchers from the MIR community\\!\n\n**Martin Hartmann**\n\nTitle: Music and Movement: exploring Social and Multimodal Dimensions of Rhythmic Entrainment.\n\nAbstract: The talk addresses key challenges in the field of music and movement through two ongoing studies at the Centre of Excellence in Music, Mind, Body and Brain at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. The first challenge explores rhythmic-social entrainment within the context of free dyadic dance. We present a study that examines the relationship between rhythmic-social entrainment and social as well as musical affiliation during adolescence, using markerless motion capture technology. Following a 2x2 factorial design, participants dance freely in dyads with a friend and with a stranger to music of their choice and to music selected by us. The second challenge focuses on the multimodality of rhythmic-social entrainment. We discuss a study that employs motion capture and surface electromyography to investigate the impact of visual cues and performed activities on acoustic features, physiological responses, and kinematic responses in choir singing. The goal is to understand how the visibility of other choir members and the performed activities (chat, homophony, polyphony, and musical improvisation) influence different types of individual and group responses. In addition to exploring the social aspects of rhythmic entrainment in dance and its multimodal nature in choir singing, we emphasize the extraction of musical features and individual and social acoustic and kinematic features. We also consider potential take-home messages from these studies for the music information retrieval community and beyond.",

    "description": "Music information technology has the potential to transform creative and artistic practice. Many technologists working in music information retrieval also at least are music lovers (if not skilled players), and as such have strong commitment to having their tools and technologies being useful in practice. At the same time, are these technologists indeed sufficiently aligning to musical and creative practice? Are the needs and interests of relevant real-life music stakeholders (players, composers, producers, other types of practitioners) who never heard about \u2018music information retrieval\u2019 sufficiently identified and recognized in technological research and development?\n\nAs Creative Practice chairs, considering ISMIR 2024\u2019s special focus on \u2018Bridging Technology and Musical Creativity\u2019, we want to stimulate more awareness of (and joint learning on) these questions. In order to do this, we wish to facilitate dialogues and collaborations on this topic between technologists and creatives. While [several community members contributed ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p5yGNEVgW_W0lKgyIRWip0sgD_kOU1ki5iEkkvv6PhA/edit?tab=t.0) on which you can respond to collaborate, at ISMIR 2024, we also will host two panels featuring invited guests who all are active on the bridges between technology and creative practice.\n\nIn today\u2019s panel, we will host and have a conversation with:\n\n* **Mark Goldstein** \\- Percussionist, programmer, teacher, inventor; with an interest in the nexus of musical gesture, sound, and expression.  \n* **Michelle Alexander** \\-    \n* **Carlos Mosquera** \\- ",

    "description": "Music information technology has the potential to transform creative and artistic practice. Many technologists working in music information retrieval also at least are music lovers (if not skilled players), and as such have strong commitment to having their tools and technologies being useful in practice. At the same time, are these technologists indeed sufficiently aligning to musical and creative practice? Are the needs and interests of relevant real-life music stakeholders (players, composers, producers, other types of practitioners) who never heard about \u2018music information retrieval\u2019 sufficiently identified and recognized in technological research and development?\n\nAs Creative Practice chairs, considering ISMIR 2024\u2019s special focus on \u2018Bridging Technology and Musical Creativity\u2019, we want to stimulate more awareness of (and joint learning on) these questions. In order to do this, we wish to facilitate dialogues and collaborations on this topic between technologists and creatives. While [several community members contributed ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p5yGNEVgW_W0lKgyIRWip0sgD_kOU1ki5iEkkvv6PhA/edit?tab=t.0) on which you can respond to collaborate, at ISMIR 2024, we also will host two panels featuring invited guests who all are active on the bridges between technology and creative practice.\n\nIn today\u2019s panel, we will host and have a conversation with:\n\n* **Eyal Amir** \\- musician, software developer and musical instruments creator. Co-founder and CTO of the audio plugins company Modalics.  \n* **Ben Cantil** aka Encanti \\- electronic music producer, software designer, educator, and scholar  \n* **Seth Forsgren** \\- Amateur Musician, CEO at Riffusion  \n* **Spencer Salazar** \\- ",

Topics do not need to be technical (example: what does MIR stands for ? do we need open-review ? does gen-ai cares about copyright ? how many multi-head do I need in my encoder ?). This is an informal and informative opportunity to get to know peers and colleagues from around the world. ",

Participants will join break-out rooms to explore how various fields, including those beyond the session topics, can inform Music Information Retrieval (MIR) or, conversely, how MIR can contribute to advancements across disciplines. Each group will talk or present their discussions, highlighting their insights and proposed synergies. The session will conclude with a collective discussion and Q&A with the Speakers, aiming to foster collaboration and generate actionable ideas for pushing the boundaries of MIR research.",
