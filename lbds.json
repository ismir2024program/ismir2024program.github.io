      "TLDR": "Cinematic audio source separation (CASS), as a standalone problem of extracting individual stems from their mixture, is a fairly new subtask of audio source separation. A typical setup of CASS is a three-stem problem, with the aim of separating the mixture into the dialogue (DX), music (MX), and effects (FX) stems. Given the creative nature of cinematic sound production, however, several edge cases exist; some sound sources do not fit neatly in any of these three stems, necessitating the use of additional auxiliary stems in production. One very common edge case is the singing voice in film audio, which may belong in either the DX or MX or neither, depending heavily on the cinematic context. In this work, we demonstrate a very straightforward extension of the dedicated-decoder Bandit and query-based single-decoder Banquet models to a four-stem problem, treating non-musical dialogue, instrumental music, singing voice, and effects as separate stems. Interestingly, the query-based Banquet model outperformed the dedicated-decoder Bandit model. We hypothesized that this is due to a better feature alignment at the bottleneck as enforced by the band-agnostic FiLM layer.",

      "TLDR": "This paper addresses the unique challenge of conducting research in lyric studies, where direct use of lyrics is often restricted due to copyright concerns. Unlike typical data, internet-sourced lyrics are frequently protected under copyright law, necessitating alternative approaches. Our study introduces a novel method for generating copyright-free lyrics from publicly available Bag-of-Words (BoW) dataset, which contain the vocabulary of lyrics but not the lyrics themselves. Utilizing metadata associated with BoW datasets and large language models, we successfully reconstructed lyrics. We have compiled and made available a dataset of reconstructed lyrics, LyCon, aligned with metadata from renowned sources including the Million Song Dataset, Deezer Mood Detection Dataset, and AllMusic Genre Dataset, available for public access. We believe that the integration of metadata such as mood annotations or genres enables a variety of academic experiments on lyrics, such as conditional lyric generation.",

However, ERGMs often face challenges like degeneracy, particularly when analyzing higher-order patterns within these networks.

      "TLDR": "Creating orchestral accompaniments for solo piano performances of concertos is challenging, especially when aiming for a system that adapts to the pianist's tempo and dynamics. In this work, we present a semi-automatic offline approach using source separation, alignment, and time-scale modification techniques to generate orchestral accompaniments from public-domain recordings. Our approach separates the orchestral part, aligns it with a new solo-piano performance played by the user, and adjusts the tempo and dynamics to match the user's interpretation.

      "abstract": "Creating orchestral accompaniments for solo piano performances of concertos is challenging, especially when aiming for a system that adapts to the pianist's tempo and dynamics. In this work, we present a semi-automatic offline approach using source separation, alignment, and time-scale modification techniques to generate orchestral accompaniments from public-domain recordings. Our approach separates the orchestral part, aligns it with a new solo-piano performance played by the user, and adjusts the tempo and dynamics to match the user's interpretation. While some processes are automated, significant manual adjustments are needed for temporal alignment and sound production. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this method while highlighting the need for further automation.

In this work, we altered conditioning method using a hypernetwork-based gated convolutional network (GCN) to generate audio that blends clean input with the tone characteristics of reference audio.\nBy extending the training data to cover a wider variety of amplifier tones, our model is able to capture a broader range of tones. Additionally, we developed a real-time plugin to demonstrate the system's practical application, allowing users to experience its performance interactively.

Leveraging video language models (VLM) and zero-shot prompting techniques, the system supports three key applications: entity discovery and browsing, multimodal self-querying retrieval, and playlist generation. The multimodal self-querying retrieval setup intelligently combines structured metadata filtering (e.g., video style, musical genre, emotion, visual elements) with lexical and semantic search, allowing users to query music videos using multiple facets. Additionally, the structured extraction powers entity discovery, enabling exploration of videos based on extracted metadata across the dataset. We provide qualitative examples of structured information extraction over an initial dataset of over 60K music videos to showcase the potential for search and video playlist generation.",

We release OpenMU-LightBench, and hope that its rich annotations can facilitate future research and development of building music understanding models based on LLMs.",

In this study, we investigated this effect on artificial neural networks by training identical autoencoders to recreate speech excerpts using datasets with varying proportions of music. We then assessed the models' performance by using transfer learning to apply the encoder to a language classification task. Our findings indicate that incorporating a small share of music into the pre-training data improved the ability of the model trained on English data to classify other languages, including Japanese and Korean, suggesting a potential benefit of music exposure in enhancing model generalization to linguistically distant languages.",

However, till date, we are unaware of any systematic approach that analyzes the quantifiable musical features in VGM across several perceived game genres. Therefore, we built an interactive system that extracts musical features from VGM on different perceived genres of video games, and then hypothesized how different musical features are correlated to the perceptions of each genre.

      "TLDR": "Music therapy has been shown in recent years to provide multiple health benefits related to emotional wellness. In turn, maintaining a healthy emotional state has proven to be effective for patients undergoing treatment, such as Parkinson's patients or patients suffering from stress and anxiety. We propose fine-tuning MusicGen, a music-generating transformer model, to create short musical clips that assist patients in transitioning from negative to desired emotional states. Using low-rank decomposition fine-tuning on the MTG-Jamendo Dataset with emotion tags, we generate 30-second clips that adhere to the iso principle, guiding patients through intermediate states in the valence-arousal circumplex. The generated music is evaluated using a music emotion recognition model to ensure alignment with intended emotions. By concatenating these clips, we produce a 15-minute \"music medicine\" resembling a music therapy session. Our approach is the first model to leverage Language Models to generate music medicine. Ultimately, the output will be used as a temporary relief between music therapy sessions with a licensed therapist.",

      "TLDR": "Musicians often represent drum beats through sound gestures such as vocal imitation and finger tapping. While these gestures can convey rich rhythmic information, realizing them as fully-produced drum beats requires time and skill. We propose a system for mapping arbitrary percussive sound gestures to high-fidelity drum recordings. Our system, dubbed TRIA (The Rhythm In Anything), takes as input two audio prompts -- one specifying the desired drum timbre, and one specifying the desired rhythm -- and generates audio satisfying both prompts (i.e. playing the desired rhythm with the desired timbre). TRIA can synthesize realistic drum audio given rhythm prompts from a variety of non-drum sound sources (e.g. beatboxing, environmental sound) in a zero-shot manner, enabling novel creative interactions.",

      "TLDR": "In our demo, participants are invited to explore the Diff-MST^C prototype, which integrates the Diff-MST model into Steinberg's digital audio workstation (DAW), Cubase. Diff-MST, a deep learning model for mixing style transfer, forecasts mixing console parameters for tracks using a reference song. The system processes up to 20 raw tracks along with a reference song to predict mixing console parameters that can be used to create an initial mix. Users have the option to manually adjust these parameters further for greater control. In contrast to earlier deep learning systems that are limited to research ideas, Diff-MST^C is a first-of-its-kind prototype integrated into a DAW. This integration facilitates mixing decisions on multitracks and lets users input context through a reference song, followed by fine-tuning of audio effects in a traditional manner.",

Often, the Raag's definition as appearing in pedagogy does not include microtonal information. Hindustani Classical Music is transcribed and spoken of with a 12-note system.

Using a semi-automatic pipeline, we evaluate two transformer configurations on VAR4000, comparing their performance with the smaller JAZZVAR dataset. Preliminary results show promising improvements in generalisation and performance with the larger dataset configuration, highlighting the potential of transformer models to scale effectively for music overpainting on larger and more diverse datasets.",

We also show that this technique helps improve downbeat tracking in an unseen Samba dataset.",

      "TLDR": "Recent progress on audio-based music structure analysis has closely aligned with the appearance of new deep learning paradigms, notably for the extraction of robust spectro-temporal audio features and their sequential modeling. However, most recent methods resort to supervised learning, which requires careful annotation of audio music pieces. Such annotations may sometimes operate at different temporal scales from one dataset to another or comprise inconsistent variation markers across repetitions of identical segments. This work explores language models as an alternative to manual pre-processing of the section label space, thus facilitating training and predictions across different annotated corpora. We propose a joint audio-to-text embedding space in which latent representations of audio frames and their respective section labels are close. We take inspiration from recent works on cross-modal contrastive learning and demonstrate the plausibility of this paradigm in the context of music structure analysis.",

In this demo, we use an existing dataset of Brazilian samba percussion to create artificial mixtures for training a U-Net model to separate the surdo drum, a traditional instrument in samba. Despite limited training data, the model effectively isolates the surdo, given the drum's repetitive patterns and its characteristic low-pitched timbre. These results suggest that MSS systems can be successfully harnessed to work in more culturally-inclusive scenarios without the need of collecting extensive amounts of data.",

      "TLDR": "Album sequencing has long been a critical part of the album production process. Recently, a data-driven approach was proposed by Ashley and Herrmann et al. (2024) for sequencing general collections of independent media by extracting the narrative essence of the items in the collection. While their approach implies an album sequencing technique, it is not widely accessible to a less technical audience, requiring advanced knowledge of machine learning techniques to use. To address this, we introduce a new user-friendly web-based tool that allows a less technical audience to upload music tracks, execute this technique in one click, and subsequently presents the result in a clean visualization to the user. To both increase the number of templates available to the user and address shortcomings of the work of Ashley and Herrmann et al., we also introduce a new direct transformer-based album sequencing method. We find that our more direct method outperforms a random baseline but does not reach the same performance as the narrative essence approach. Both methods are included in our web-based user interface, and this\u2014alongside a full copy of our implementation\u2014is publicly available at REDACTED",

      "TLDR": "Music captioning has emerged as a promising task, fueled by the advent of advanced language generation models. However, the evaluation of music captioning relies heavily on traditional metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE which were developed for other domains, without proper justification for their use in this new field. We present cases where traditional metrics are vulnerable to syntactic changes, and show they do not correlate well with human judgments. By addressing these issues, we aim to emphasize the need for a critical reevaluation of how music captions are assessed.",

      "TLDR": "Leitmotifs are musical phrases that reprise in various forms throughout a piece. Detecting the occurrence of leitmotifs from audio recordings is a highly challenging task, due to diverse variations and instrumentation. Leitmotif detection can be regarded as a subcategory of audio event detection, where the appearance of leitmotifs is predicted at the frame level. However, as leitmotifs carry distinct temporal structures and musical coherence, a more holistic approach akin to bounding box regression in visual object detection can be helpful. This would capture the entirety of the motif rather than fragmenting it into individual frames, thereby preserving its musical integrity and enhancing detection accuracy. We present our results on tackling leitmotif detection as a boundary regression task.",

      "TLDR": "We are interested in score reduction, specifically the task of adapting musical scores originally composed for another instrument (e.g. piano) into scores playable on the guitar. This process, traditionally performed by experienced guitarists, is complex and time-consuming. This study proposes to automate this task by framing score reduction as a combinatorial optimization problem under constraints and use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve it. The RL agent sequentially evaluates notes in the input score, deciding whether to keep or discard each note and selecting its position on the guitar fretboard. We use a graph representation for scores and utilize a transformer encoder to capture the state. The guitar's physical characteristics and the need to retain the musicality of the original score present challenging constraints. We design two reward functions to balance the trade-off between musicality and playability and train the agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).",

The features can be extracted as latent or post-processed labels, enabling integration into music applications such as generative music, recommendation, and playlist generation. The modular design allows easy integration of newly developed systems, making it a good benchmarking and comparison tool.
