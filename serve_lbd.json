    "Abstract": "MusicGen is a music generation language model (LM) that can be conditioned on textual descriptions and melodic features. We introduce \bMusicGen-Chord, which extends this capability by incorporating chord progression features. This model modifies one-hot encoded melody chroma vectors into multi-hot encoded chord chroma vectors, enabling the generation of music that reflects both chord progressions and textual descriptions. Furthermore, we developed MusicGen-Remixer, an application utilizing MusicGen-Chord to generate remixes of input music conditioned on textual descriptions. Both models are integrated into Replicate\u2019s web-UI using cog, facilitating broad accessibility and user-friendly controllable interaction for creating and experiencing AI-generated music.",

    "Abstract": "Cinematic audio source separation (CASS), as a standalone problem of extracting individual stems from their mixture, is a fairly new subtask of audio source separation. A typical setup of CASS is a three-stem problem, with the aim of separating the mixture into the dialogue (DX), music (MX), and effects (FX) stems. Given the creative nature of cinematic sound production, however, several edge cases exist; some sound sources do not fit neatly in any of these three stems, necessitating the use of additional auxiliary stems in production. One very common edge case is the singing voice in film audio, which may belong in either the DX or MX or neither, depending heavily on the cinematic context. In this work, we demonstrate a very straightforward extension of the dedicated-decoder Bandit and query-based single-decoder Banquet models to a four-stem problem, treating non-musical dialogue, instrumental music, singing voice, and effects as separate stems. Interestingly, the query-based Banquet model outperformed the dedicated-decoder Bandit model. We hypothesized that this is due to a better feature alignment at the bottleneck as enforced by the band-agnostic FiLM layer.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the generation of classical piano performances conditioned on individual performers' expressive styles. \n The interpretative diversity in classical music naturally results in comparisons and preferences for different interpretations of the same piece, fostering a desire to explore performances in varied styles.\n However, most research in music style transfer has primarily focused on timbre and compositional changes, with limited success in transferring performance style due to the difficulty of separating style from music content.\n To address this, we propose a novel approach that utilizes easily obtainable audio data and employs a flow matching model to generate high-quality, style-conditioned audio performances.\n We created datasets from pianists Seong-Jin Cho and Lang Lang to demonstrate our method, successfully generating performances in their distinct styles. \n This work expands the possibilities for performance style transfer and can potentially be applied to other performers' styles with additional audio data.",

We employ variational autoencoders to train the model using a query-based inference network. Given a mixture, the model allows for precise source-level attribute editing, e.g., instrument or pitch replacement, by manipulating the pitch and timbre latents. On the synthetic audio clips of chords compiled using the JSB Chorales dataset, our quantitative evaluation protocol shows empirical success of the model on both pitch-timbre disentanglement of individual sources and source-level attribute manipulation of mixtures.",

    "Abstract": "This paper addresses the unique challenge of conducting research in lyric studies, where direct use of lyrics is often restricted due to copyright concerns. Unlike typical data, internet-sourced lyrics are frequently protected under copyright law, necessitating alternative approaches. Our study introduces a novel method for generating copyright-free lyrics from publicly available Bag-of-Words (BoW) dataset, which contain the vocabulary of lyrics but not the lyrics themselves. Utilizing metadata associated with BoW datasets and large language models, we successfully reconstructed lyrics. We have compiled and made available a dataset of reconstructed lyrics, LyCon, aligned with metadata from renowned sources including the Million Song Dataset, Deezer Mood Detection Dataset, and AllMusic Genre Dataset, available for public access. We believe that the integration of metadata such as mood annotations or genres enables a variety of academic experiments on lyrics, such as conditional lyric generation.",

This paper introduces Matchmaker, an open source Python library for real-time music alignment. Unlike offline alignment methods, for which state-of-the-art implementations are publicly available, real-time (online) methods have no standard implementation, forcing researchers and developers to build them from scratch for their projects. We aim to provide efficient reference implementations of score followers for use in real-time applications which can be easily integrated into existing projects. We also aim to provide guidelines to help researchers and developers select an appropriate configuration for their applications.",

However, symbolic-domain controllable music generation has lagged behind due to the lack of a large-scale symbolic music dataset with extensive metadata and captions. In this paper, we present MetaScore, a new dataset consisting of 963K musical scores paired with rich metadata collected from an online music forum and generated psudo captions. With MetaScore, we explore tag- and text-based controllable symbolic music generation. \n Both subjective test and objective test showcase the potential of our dataset in tag- and text-conditioned music generation.",

    "Abstract": "Network analysis, especially through models like Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs), is crucial in understanding how musical styles, trends, and cultural influences diffuse through networks of musicians. However, ERGMs often face challenges like degeneracy, particularly when analyzing higher-order patterns within these networks. The Latent Order Logistic Regression (LOLOG) model provides an alternative by modeling connections as they form sequentially, which helps avoid degeneracy. To further enhance this model, we propose incorporating triadic independency, wherein we can capture more complex relationships in musical collaborations, offering deeper insights into how cultural information spreads and evolves within these networks. This enhanced model is being tested on networks of Australian musicians to assess its effectiveness in tracing collaboration patterns and enhancing music information retrieval, while also reflecting the cultural dynamics within these communities.",

    "Abstract": "Wavetable synthesis generates quasi-periodic waveforms of musical tones by interpolating a list of waveforms called wavetable. Studies in wavetable generation with invertible architecture have arisen recently. However, it is still challenging to generate wavetables with detailed controls within the latent representation. In response, we present Wavespace, a framework for wavetable generation that empowers users with enhanced parameter controls. Our model allows users to apply timbral conditions to the output wavetables. Users handle a latent space factorized by each timbral group called style. Then they adjust timbral details with descriptors. This way, users can create wavetables by manipulating timbral parameters step by step. Our framework is efficient enough for practical use; we prototyped an oscillator plug-in for real-time integration of Wavespace within digital audio workspaces (DAWs).",

    "Abstract": "In a general Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based beat and downbeat tracking pipeline, a post-processing stage is required to refine the beat/downbeat posteriors estimated by the DNN. \n A widely used post-processing method is to infer the beat/downbeat sequence that maximizes the likelihood of a probabilistic model such as the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). In this work, we aim to train a DNN that can directly estimate consistent beat/downbeat posteriors without the need for post-processing. We adopt regularization approach that minimizes the difference between the DNN and the DBN. We experimentally show that the DNN trained with the regularization loss can estimate beat and downbeat posteriors with higher temporal consistency, reducing the need for post-processing.",

    "Abstract": "Creating orchestral accompaniments for solo piano performances of concertos is challenging, especially when aiming for a system that adapts to the pianist's tempo and dynamics. In this work, we present a semi-automatic offline approach using source separation, alignment, and time-scale modification techniques to generate orchestral accompaniments from public-domain recordings. Our approach separates the orchestral part, aligns it with a new solo-piano performance played by the user, and adjusts the tempo and dynamics to match the user's interpretation. While some processes are automated, significant manual adjustments are needed for temporal alignment and sound production. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this method while highlighting the need for further automation. We have made the multi-track recordings of the created mixes publicly available for research purposes at https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/PCD_AudioLabs.",

In this paper, we propose the ITO-Master framework, which introduces Inference Time Optimization (ITO) on reference embeddings to improve the mastering style transfer process. Our approach achieves effective automatic mastering and gives users flexibility, enabling them to adapt the system to their preferences by adjusting the reference song or specific audio effects traits. We explore both black-box and differentiable methods, demonstrating that ITO improves performance on key metrics.

    "Abstract": "Electric guitar tone modeling typically focuses on the non-linear transformation from clean to amplifier-rendered audio. Traditional methods rely on one-to-one mappings, incorporating device parameters into neural models to replicate specific amplifiers. However, these methods are limited by the need for specific training data. \nIn this paper, we adapt a model based on the previous work, which leverages a tone embedding encoder and a feature wise linear modulation (FiLM) condition method. In this work, we altered conditioning method using a hypernetwork-based gated convolutional network (GCN) to generate audio that blends clean input with the tone characteristics of reference audio.\nBy extending the training data to cover a wider variety of amplifier tones, our model is able to capture a broader range of tones. Additionally, we developed a real-time plugin to demonstrate the system's practical application, allowing users to experience its performance interactively. Our results indicate that the proposed system achieves superior tone modeling versatility compared to traditional methods.",

    "Abstract": "We present in this paper the extended online HI-AUDIO platform which relies on a distributed and iterative music recording paradigm to asynchronously record musicians localised at different remote individual sites. The major goal of this platform is to become a key enabling tool for building a large, varied, multi-genre, multi-track, multi-instrument music dataset, to be ultimately publicly distributed for MIR research purposes. We describe in this paper the main characteristics of the web platform and discuss some of the major challenges for collecting music data on the web. The platform will be demonstrated on site with local and distant access and illustrate its merits for recording collaborative compositions.",

    "Abstract": "In this study we introduce early results for a music video structured extraction framework designed to extract key metadata and descriptions such as genre, mood, video style, and summaries of general music, lyrical and visual narrative content. Leveraging video language models (VLM) and zero-shot prompting techniques, the system supports three key applications: entity discovery and browsing, multimodal self-querying retrieval, and playlist generation. The multimodal self-querying retrieval setup intelligently combines structured metadata filtering (e.g., video style, musical genre, emotion, visual elements) with lexical and semantic search, allowing users to query music videos using multiple facets. Additionally, the structured extraction powers entity discovery, enabling exploration of videos based on extracted metadata across the dataset. We provide qualitative examples of structured information extraction over an initial dataset of over 60K music videos to showcase the potential for search and video playlist generation.",

Previous foundation models typically adopt an auto-regressive language modeling or masked language modeling as a training objective, which yields limited performance on some downstream tasks like source separation. In this extended abstract, we propose a new training target via self-supervised demixing of two randomly mixed music pieces. We show that with this only training target, the model learns strong general-propose representation, and also shows good performance on source separation tasks when Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is applied.",

    "Abstract": "Music processing is known to emerge spontaneously in early development, yet the impact of music exposure on brain development and cognitive abilities, such as language acquisition, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated this effect on artificial neural networks by training identical autoencoders to recreate speech excerpts using datasets with varying proportions of music. We then assessed the models' performance by using transfer learning to apply the encoder to a language classification task. Our findings indicate that incorporating a small share of music into the pre-training data improved the ability of the model trained on English data to classify other languages, including Japanese and Korean, suggesting a potential benefit of music exposure in enhancing model generalization to linguistically distant languages.",

    "Abstract": "In the field of ludomusicology that overlaps the interests of sound and games, video game music (VGM) is often studied under the same lens as film music, which largely focuses on its theoretical functionality with relation to the perceived genres of the media. However, till date, we are unaware of any systematic approach that analyzes the quantifiable musical features in VGM across several perceived game genres. Therefore, we built an interactive system that extracts musical features from VGM on different perceived genres of video games, and then hypothesized how different musical features are correlated to the perceptions of each genre. This observed correlation may be used to further suggest such features are relevant to the expected elements associated with the sub-genre.",

    "Abstract": "We are investigating whether an AI-based generative music (Gen-AI) system returns original song audio in response to the same text prompts.  To determine a similarity threshold for our analysis, we compare audio from human-composed song pairs that were previously involved in actual copyright disputes. Participants are tasked with sending the same 8 text prompts, specifically designed for our investigation, to the Gen-AI system.  By comparing all returned Gen-AI songs to each other, a maximum 8-beat correlation value is determined for each unique song pairing. Gen-AI songs pairs are deemed too similar -- or unoriginal relative to each other -- if their maximum 8-beat correlation value exceeds the similarity threshold. We observe that 54% of Gen-AI song pairs fall into this category. Prompts that exhibit the highest probability for exceeding the threshold include mentions of a specific musical genre or song title.  Our preliminary results suggest that the Gen-AI system struggles to generate original material when different users send the same prompts.",

    "Abstract": "The scarcity of symbolic music datasets has long been a challenge in the field of music information retrieval. Many studies have emphasized the need for high-quality, manually annotated datasets that include multifaceted labels, or focus on underrepresented periods like the Romantic period. In this paper, we present the S3, Symbolic Symphony Set, a comprehensive collection featuring four symphonies, totalling 16 movements, by Mozart, Beethoven, Dvorak, and Tchaikovsky. This dataset includes XML files and detailed annotations in the CSV format for notes and musical structure on both horizontal and vertical aspects, which are commonly known as form-related and texture-related information.  The note annotations are semi-automatically generated. Form-related information includes form analysis, cadence, and harmony, while orchestral texture include the role (melody, rhythm, harmony, or mixed) for each instrument. All annotations have been converted into CSV format to facilitate further analysis and modeling. Additionally, manually annotated PDF files are included in the dataset for reference. Our dataset is available on https://github.com/iis-mctl/mctl-symphony-dataset.",

    "Abstract": "Previous research suggests that musical phrase structures may synchronise listeners' autonomic variables. We use a computational method to automatically identify probabilistic phrase arc boundaries from music audio and compare them to physiological envelopes (respiration and RR intervals). Automating the evaluation of synchronisation of autonomic responses to musical phrases enables the empirical evaluation of music's physiology-modulating power. Participants' respiration and RR intervals were recorded while listening to versions of Prokofiev's Gavotte Op.12 No.2. A novel Bayesian dynamic programming algorithm is used to derive phrase boundary credence profiles from the loudness. \nIncreased curve similarity is observed between loudness phrase boundary credences and listeners' physiological signal envelopes, with the degree of response affected by track version. Loudness credence and RR interval entrainment is statistically significant for the original version.\nWe developed a fully automated system for evaluating musical phrase arc-autonomic variable entrainment. Initial findings suggest that phrase structures can affect physiological signals.",

    "Abstract": "Music therapy has been shown in recent years to provide multiple health benefits related to emotional wellness. In turn, maintaining a healthy emotional state has proven to be effective for patients undergoing treatment, such as Parkinson's patients or patients suffering from stress and anxiety. We propose fine-tuning MusicGen, a music-generating transformer model, to create short musical clips that assist patients in transitioning from negative to desired emotional states. Using low-rank decomposition fine-tuning on the MTG-Jamendo Dataset with emotion tags, we generate 30-second clips that adhere to the iso principle, guiding patients through intermediate states in the valence-arousal circumplex. The generated music is evaluated using a music emotion recognition model to ensure alignment with intended emotions. By concatenating these clips, we produce a 15-minute \"music medicine\" resembling a music therapy session. Our approach is the first model to leverage Language Models to generate music medicine. Ultimately, the output will be used as a temporary relief between music therapy sessions with a licensed therapist.",

    "Abstract": "The musicologists Jesse Rodin and Joshua Rifkin have presented an important taxonomy of works that could potentially be attributed to the Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez. It is broken into five categories indicating how strong the evidence is that Josquin was the composer of the given pieces, based primarily on historical evidence from sources and biography. We apply statistical analysis and machine learning to features extracted from the scores of all this music using our jSymbolic software to see how well a purely content-based approach supports (or contradicts) this taxonomy. We also identify particularly statistically characteristic features of Josquin\u2019s style.",

    "Abstract": "Visual cues are essential for synchronization in ensemble performances, especially at the start of a piece or during fermatas with sudden tempo changes, where gestures facilitate coordination. However, in human-automated piano ensembles, traditional gesture cues are inapplicable due to the absence of a pianist. To address this, we propose a real-time gesture cue detection and visual feedback system which is structured into two main components: (1) the development of an accompaniment system that detects flutists\u2019 gesture cues and predicts onset timings for initiating playback, and (2) the provision of real-time visual feedback regarding cue detection status, enabling performers to synchronize with the system effectively.\nThe bidirectional gesture cue detection and visual feedback system was empirically validated in live performances with professional musicians, demonstrating its capability to maintain a natural musical flow. This approach surpasses the limitations of previous audio-based accompaniment systems by incorporating gesture cues at critical moments, such as the start of pieces and fermata passages, enabling optimized reactive accompaniment.",

We compare these methods against existing techniques, including bar patching, byte patching, and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). In terms of both computational efficiency and the musicality of the generated compositions, experimental results show that bar-stream patching performs best overall compared to the others, which makes it a promising tokenization strategy for sheet music generation.",

    "Abstract": "Musicians often represent drum beats through sound gestures such as vocal imitation and finger tapping. While these gestures can convey rich rhythmic information, realizing them as fully-produced drum beats requires time and skill. We propose a system for mapping arbitrary percussive sound gestures to high-fidelity drum recordings. Our system, dubbed TRIA (The Rhythm In Anything), takes as input two audio prompts -- one specifying the desired drum timbre, and one specifying the desired rhythm -- and generates audio satisfying both prompts (i.e. playing the desired rhythm with the desired timbre). TRIA can synthesize realistic drum audio given rhythm prompts from a variety of non-drum sound sources (e.g. beatboxing, environmental sound) in a zero-shot manner, enabling novel creative interactions.",

    "Abstract": "In our demo, participants are invited to explore the Diff-MST^C prototype, which integrates the Diff-MST model into Steinberg's digital audio workstation (DAW), Cubase. Diff-MST, a deep learning model for mixing style transfer, forecasts mixing console parameters for tracks using a reference song. The system processes up to 20 raw tracks along with a reference song to predict mixing console parameters that can be used to create an initial mix. Users have the option to manually adjust these parameters further for greater control. In contrast to earlier deep learning systems that are limited to research ideas, Diff-MST^C is a first-of-its-kind prototype integrated into a DAW. This integration facilitates mixing decisions on multitracks and lets users input context through a reference song, followed by fine-tuning of audio effects in a traditional manner.",

    "Abstract": "The presentation of Indian Classical Music admits the use of microtones (\"shruti\"s or frequency ratios) that are characteristic of each Raag which can be described as a set of notes (a scale) plus a \"chalan\" (melody patterns and rules regarding permissible/emphasized combinations of notes) meant to create a certain mood. Often, the Raag's definition as appearing in pedagogy does not include microtonal information. Hindustani Classical Music is transcribed and spoken of with a 12-note system. Despite this, most advanced vocalists or musicians with a continuous-frequency-domain instrument will tend to use appropriate microtones during rendition. This suggests that the microtonal information may be consistently derived based on the given description of the Raag. In this study, we attempt to use empirical analysis and MIR techniques to discover rules, if any, that may guide this derivation algorithmically.",

Music overpainting generates new variations while preserving the melodic and harmonic structure of the input. Existing approaches are limited by small datasets, restricting scalability and diversity. We introduce VAR4000, a subset of a larger dataset for jazz piano performances, consisting of 4,352 training pairs. Using a semi-automatic pipeline, we evaluate two transformer configurations on VAR4000, comparing their performance with the smaller JAZZVAR dataset. Preliminary results show promising improvements in generalisation and performance with the larger dataset configuration, highlighting the potential of transformer models to scale effectively for music overpainting on larger and more diverse datasets.",

    "Abstract": "Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT) remains a challenging task in MIR but recent advances allow accurate transcription of drum kits with up 5 classes - kick, snare, hi-hats, toms and cymbals - via the ADTOF package. In addition, several drum kit stem separation models in the open source community support separation for more than 6 stem classes, including for distinct crash and ride cymbals. In this work we explore the benefits of combining these tools to improve the realism and accuracy of drum transcriptions. We describe a simple post-processing step which expands the transcription output from five to seven classes. Furthermore, we are able to estimate MIDI velocity values based on the separated stems. Our solution achieves strong performance when assessed against a baseline of 8-class drum transcription and produces realistic MIDI transcriptions suitable for MIR or music production tasks.",

    "Abstract": "Most music consumption involves multi-instrument audio, and thus modeling complex timbres is vital for real-world music analysis and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks. However, this task remains challenging in musical mixtures where definitions of timbre are less clear. Additionally, the advent of generative and multi-modal music models necessitates precise timbre representation for enhanced control in music generation and editing. Based on previous work highlighting the difficulties with learning instrument timbres in the context of Predominant Instrument Recognition (PIR), we explore the potential of diffusion networks to learn salient timbre representations for predominant instrument generation and timbre transfer. The results highlight the power of generative models to deepen our understanding of instrument timbre for complex scenarios with limited real-world data.",

    "Abstract": "Beat and downbeat tracking models are predominantly developed using datasets with music in 4/4 meter, which decreases their generalization to repertories in other time signatures.  In this work, we propose a simple augmentation technique to increase the representation of time signatures beyond 4/4, namely 2/4 and 3/4. Our augmentation procedure works by removing beat intervals from 4/4 annotated tracks. We show that the augmented\ndata helps to improve downbeat tracking for underrepresented meters while preserving the overall performance of beat tracking in two different models. We also show that this technique helps improve downbeat tracking in an unseen Samba dataset.",

    "Abstract": "Recent progress on audio-based music structure analysis has closely aligned with the appearance of new deep learning paradigms, notably for the extraction of robust spectro-temporal audio features and their sequential modeling. However, most recent methods resort to supervised learning, which requires careful annotation of audio music pieces. Such annotations may sometimes operate at different temporal scales from one dataset to another or comprise inconsistent variation markers across repetitions of identical segments. This work explores language models as an alternative to manual pre-processing of the section label space, thus facilitating training and predictions across different annotated corpora. We propose a joint audio-to-text embedding space in which latent representations of audio frames and their respective section labels are close. We take inspiration from recent works on cross-modal contrastive learning and demonstrate the plausibility of this paradigm in the context of music structure analysis.",

    "Abstract": "Musical source separation (MSS) has recently seen a big breakthrough in separating instruments from a mixture in the context of Western music, but research on non-Western instruments is still limited due to a lack of data. In this demo, we use an existing dataset of Brazilian samba percussion to create artificial mixtures for training a U-Net model to separate the surdo drum, a traditional instrument in samba. Despite limited training data, the model effectively isolates the surdo, given the drum's repetitive patterns and its characteristic low-pitched timbre. These results suggest that MSS systems can be successfully harnessed to work in more culturally-inclusive scenarios without the need of collecting extensive amounts of data.",

    "Abstract": "Much of the research in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) relies on data: collections of audio recordings, musical scores, meta-information about music, human opinions, and more. The International Society for MIR (ISMIR) Conference offers a glimpse into the data being used in MIR research and thus what is (and is not) studied by the field. Unlike past ISMIR conference proceedings with consistent metadata on each paper, there does not exist a comprehensive repository with detailed metadata on the datasets used in ISMIR papers. We propose a collection tool for community-sourcing the meta information about the data of ISMIR as well as a procedure for processing and cleaning that collected data. We view this as a necessary first step towards being able to quantify the influence of certain datasets across MIR as well as address questions of data diversity and generalizability of MIR work.",

Various filters are applied to shape the harmonic and timbral characteristics of the instrument, which are then reproduced through vibrations in the soundboard. The acoustic and filtered sounds are played simultaneously, allowing listeners to perceive how different filters color the natural resonance of the piano. This investigation focuses on how specific filters alter the tonal quality of the instrument and explores their potential for creative sound manipulation within acoustic contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Use of data in AI systems without consent or in violation of copyright agreements has become a pressing concern as AI systems have become increasingly capable and commercialized. In the audio domain, these concerns extend to music styles, voice prints, and lyrics being replicated and extended, causing economic, security, and representation harms. In this paper we present initial work on protecting audio from unauthorized AI inference, including voice cloning and music extension. We utilize encoder-based attacks to add noise to audio to distort the encoded latent while minimally changing the original audio. We conduct small-scale experiments showing the effectiveness of our protection, and discuss next steps needed to develop a defense that is both effective and acceptable to audio workers. We present our results at tinyurl.com/audio-protection.",

    "Abstract": "Quantifying similarity of melodic features has been a chal-\nlenge not only in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), but\nmusic theory in general. Despite this, music theoretical\nmodels are often underutilized in music informatics. Mu-\nsic theory informed models can provide certain advan-\ntages over pure machine learning models, such as resource-\nefficiency and interpretability. This paper proposes the ap-\nplication of Earth Mover\u2019s Distance onto a novel represen-\ntation of the interval content of a song based on the cir-\ncle of fifths, dubbing the resulting distance metric Inter-\nval Mover\u2019s Distance. Interval Mover\u2019s Distance may be\napplied to various MIR tasks concerning stylistic similar-\nity, such as music recommendation algorithms, and par-\nticularly, novel machine learning tasks such as manifold\nlearning. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projec-\ntion (UMAP) is then used to demonstrate this metric in\nmanifold learning resulting in a large corpus of music rep-\nresented on a \"music map\" by melodic content. This mu-\nsic map, dubbed \"Every Interval at Once\", visualizes\nand sonifies the spectrum of data available, thus blurring\nthe lines between music data visualization and data-driven\nsound art.In addition, the MIDI dataset collected for this project,\nspanning 23,059 songs across 75 unique genres, is released\nfor public use.",

This study investigates the impact of white noise at various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels on state-of-the-art APT models and evaluates the performance of the Onsets and Frames model when trained on noise-augmented data.

    "Abstract": "Music perception is shaped by both enculturation and musical training. This pilot study explores how musicians from different cultural and training backgrounds perceive music. Participants rated the perceived \"Westernness\" of raga samples in an online survey. Our analysis revealed significant differences in ratings between Western and Indian musicians, with a strong correlation between the perceived Westernness of the raga samples and their pitch class distributions. These findings suggest that musical training and cultural background influence familiarity with specific pitch class structures, leading to variations in music perception. Ongoing research will investigate the neural correlates of music perception across diverse musical cultures.\n",

    "Abstract": "With the advancement of generative models, controllable music generation (e.g., emotion-based) has gradually become feasible. However, achieving a balance between controllability and musicality/generative quality remains a challenging task in current research. Existing latent space-based methods, such as MusER, have struggled to capture the complex patterns underlying emotional expression and music theory. In this late-breaking demo, we present a preliminary study on emotion-based piano score generation. Our approach aims to enhance the controllability and accuracy of emotional content by disentangling musical elements. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage generation structure with pre-training to address the scarcity of emotion-labeled datasets, thereby improving the quality of the generated content and the robustness of the generation process.",

In music, where labeled data is scarce, existing SSL methods typically use generated supervision and multi-view redundancy to create pretext tasks. However, these approaches often produce entangled representations and lose view-specific information. We propose a novel self-supervised multi-view learning framework for audio designed to incentivize separation between private and shared representation spaces.

    "Abstract": "Album sequencing has long been a critical part of the album production process. Recently, a data-driven approach was proposed by Ashley and Herrmann et al. (2024) for sequencing general collections of independent media by extracting the narrative essence of the items in the collection. While their approach implies an album sequencing technique, it is not widely accessible to a less technical audience, requiring advanced knowledge of machine learning techniques to use. To address this, we introduce a new user-friendly web-based tool that allows a less technical audience to upload music tracks, execute this technique in one click, and subsequently presents the result in a clean visualization to the user. To both increase the number of templates available to the user and address shortcomings of the work of Ashley and Herrmann et al., we also introduce a new direct transformer-based album sequencing method. We find that our more direct method outperforms a random baseline but does not reach the same performance as the narrative essence approach. Both methods are included in our web-based user interface, and this\u2014alongside a full copy of our implementation\u2014is publicly available at REDACTED",

    "Abstract": "Music captioning has emerged as a promising task, fueled by the advent of advanced language generation models. However, the evaluation of music captioning relies heavily on traditional metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE which were developed for other domains, without proper justification for their use in this new field. We present cases where traditional metrics are vulnerable to syntactic changes, and show they do not correlate well with human judgments. By addressing these issues, we aim to emphasize the need for a critical reevaluation of how music captions are assessed.",

    "Abstract": "Leitmotifs are musical phrases that reprise in various forms throughout a piece. Detecting the occurrence of leitmotifs from audio recordings is a highly challenging task, due to diverse variations and instrumentation. Leitmotif detection can be regarded as a subcategory of audio event detection, where the appearance of leitmotifs is predicted at the frame level. However, as leitmotifs carry distinct temporal structures and musical coherence, a more holistic approach akin to bounding box regression in visual object detection can be helpful. This would capture the entirety of the motif rather than fragmenting it into individual frames, thereby preserving its musical integrity and enhancing detection accuracy. We present our results on tackling leitmotif detection as a boundary regression task.",

    "Abstract": "We are interested in score reduction, specifically the task of adapting musical scores originally composed for another instrument (e.g. piano) into scores playable on the guitar. This process, traditionally performed by experienced guitarists, is complex and time-consuming. This study proposes to automate this task by framing score reduction as a combinatorial optimization problem under constraints and use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve it. The RL agent sequentially evaluates notes in the input score, deciding whether to keep or discard each note and selecting its position on the guitar fretboard. We use a graph representation for scores and utilize a transformer encoder to capture the state. The guitar's physical characteristics and the need to retain the musicality of the original score present challenging constraints. We design two reward functions to balance the trade-off between musicality and playability and train the agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).",

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces an extendable modular system that compiles a range of music feature extraction models to aid music information retrieval research. The features include musical elements like key, downbeats, and genre, as well as audio characteristics like instrument recognition, vocals/instrumental classification, and vocals gender detection. The integrated models are state-of-the-art or latest open-source. The features can be extracted as latent or post-processed labels, enabling integration into music applications such as generative music, recommendation, and playlist generation. The modular design allows easy integration of newly developed systems, making it a good benchmarking and comparison tool. This versatile toolkit supports the research community in developing innovative solutions by providing concrete musical features.",
